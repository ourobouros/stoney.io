		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've not spent pretty much my entire summer working far too hard, far too long, but hey...it's almost to an end now.   I've built a few new websites (http://farringtonfoundation.org and http://benefitadvantage.net), and I've been working for 360 while doing that...in other words, sleep has kinda escaped me.

But enough of my boringness....I was out back today with the puppy, and I had my camera with me.  I was happy about that, her not so much -- she has started to hate when I pull out the camera...whoops.
<a rel="attachment wp-att-4" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/08/23/a-few-thoughts-before-leaving/img_1510/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4" title="Gracie springs through the air!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_1510-300x200.jpg" alt="Gracie springs through the air!" width="300" height="200" /></a>
She was a bit excited about what she saw...aka, nothing, but she had to chase it -- what kind of dog would she be otherwise?
<a rel="attachment wp-att-10" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/08/23/a-few-thoughts-before-leaving/img_1586/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10" title="Gracie...the Pikka Bird" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_1586-300x200.jpg" alt="Gracie...the Pikka Bird" width="300" height="200" /></a>I swear that she is a Pikka Bird sometimes, for she cannot focus on one thing for too long before she loses interest, or sometimes she finds random anonymous atoms in the air more interesting than me.
<a rel="attachment wp-att-9" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/08/23/a-few-thoughts-before-leaving/img_1577/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9" title="Just a cool shot of gracie...the sun was setting, and I wanted a picture." src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_1577-300x200.jpg" alt="Just a cool shot of gracie...the sun was setting, and I wanted a picture." width="300" height="200" /></a>And then she'll completely surprise me again by stopping to pose for a picture...and making it good!
<a rel="attachment wp-att-5" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/08/23/a-few-thoughts-before-leaving/img_1490/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5" title="Silhouette of me and Gracie" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_1490-300x200.jpg" alt="Silhouette of me and Gracie" width="300" height="200" />
And finally, who can forget the "Boy and his dog" picture?</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What Gracie thinks of my leaving</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the poor puppy is kinda torn up that I'm leaving...she's been extra cuddly and close lately.  I mean, I am really going to miss her, but at the same time, I'm completely looking forward to going forward and finding the new world!  Err, old world!  Err, across the pond!  But anyway...Gracie seems just a bit annoyed that I would be leaving, see for yourself:<a rel="attachment wp-att-78" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/08/26/what-gracie-thinks-of-my-leaving/img_1786/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-78" title="Angry Gracie" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_1786-400x266.jpg" alt="Angry Gracie" width="400" height="266" /></a>Doesn't she look so ferocious?  Yeah, I didn't think so, either, but I didn't have the heart to tell her.

But on a completely different note, Marisa and I were talking about this really cool effect that we didn't know how to do with the camera a while ago.  Anyway, long story short, the maiden in the castle is dead and Humperdink rules the land...well, sorta.  Anyway, I finally figured out how to make that really cool shot happen:<a rel="attachment wp-att-79" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/08/26/what-gracie-thinks-of-my-leaving/img_1683/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-79" title="Zoom Effect" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_1683-400x266.jpg" alt="Zoom Effect" width="400" height="266" /></a>As the description of the image says, I was able to accomplish this shot (granted the blur didn't come out exactly as I would have liked, but I'm still new!) by hitting the shutter button and zooming in on her at the same time.  If the shutter speed was too slow, then all I got was blur, and if too fast, then a sharp image.  Thus, in order to get this, I had to set my shutter to ~1/5 second and try to get something.  This was my first real attempt at such an image, so I hope it didn't turn out too bad.  I mean, the next one is a lot harder to look at...<a rel="attachment wp-att-80" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/08/26/what-gracie-thinks-of-my-leaving/img_1685/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-80" title="A really blurry Gracie" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_1685-400x266.jpg" alt="A really blurry Gracie" width="400" height="266" /></a>And, finally, before I leave, there is one last picture of her I got...I'm not quite sure what it reminds me of, but the picture looks like one I've seen before.<a rel="attachment wp-att-81" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/08/26/what-gracie-thinks-of-my-leaving/img_1670/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-81" title="A Gracie looking like something else" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_1670-400x266.jpg" alt="A Gracie looking like something else" width="400" height="266" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I finally did it -- that's right, I finally made it to Germany.   It took 13 hours of flying, 1 transfer, 3 meals, too much walking, and a cab ride, but I finally made it!   With my first trip through airport security, I almost took out one of those posts that says "do not cross" and wardens off a zone for TSA officers only...yeah, I didn't watch where I was going.   In my second trip through airport security (the Swiss don't trust American security, so we had to go through again -- and they didn't make me take my shoes off when I went through in Switzerland), and I must say, their security is quite a bit better than ours.   Not only did they have all sorts of other equipment that we're still debating how to pay for and if we're allowed to see under other people's clothes (let's just put it this way: I was one of the most-dressed people in the airport and I was wearing flip-flops, shirts, and a T-Shirt), but they were also using it!  And, apparently, they think I'm French.  When I first tried going through, the woman helping at the little X-ray belt thingy started speaking to me in French, so I told her in German that I speak German, and things got easier.  Yes, apparently I look French, or all Americans speak French...I'm not sure.

But as I got through security, I waited at my little gate -- with a 45 minute transfer, much tighter security, a terminal transfer, and a delayed flight, I still got to my gate with a little over 30 minutes to spare.  Say what you will about the Swiss (and their chocolate...they gave it to us on the flight, yay!), but they're efficient and good at what they do.

After another flight out of Switzerland, I finally made it to my place: Germany.  From the airport, I took a cab to my apartment, and I'm not sure who looked more Californian, me or the driver...  Oh, and the cab was also a BMW!  Yeah, in Germany, things are a bit different.<a rel="attachment wp-att-91" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/04/no-i-do-not-speak-french/img_1863/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-91" title="A view from outside my door" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_1863-400x266.jpg" alt="A view from outside my door" width="400" height="266" /></a>But when I got here, things got awesome...okay, things got hurt.  I'm not entirely sure what happened yesterday,  but I was not really present for most of it.  We went on a walking tour today, and let's just say that it has been many moons since my feet have killed like this...<a rel="attachment wp-att-94" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/04/no-i-do-not-speak-french/img_1878/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-94" title="Where we live." src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_1878-400x266.jpg" alt="Where we live." width="400" height="266" /></a>And there is my room -- the black one on the left.  Well, not really -- this is a squater village that is not too far from us.  Awesome, eh?<a rel="attachment wp-att-93" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/04/no-i-do-not-speak-french/img_1867/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-93" title="My streets" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_1867-400x266.jpg" alt="My streets" width="400" height="266" /></a>This is really where I live -- Adalberstraße by Engeldamm.  Our apartments are just a few hundred yards from the site where the old wall stood, which has now become a sunken garden (it used to be a canal, now they're doing something more with it).<a rel="attachment wp-att-97" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/04/no-i-do-not-speak-french/img_1894/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-97" title="A sunken garden by us." src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_1894-400x266.jpg" alt="A sunken garden by us." width="400" height="266" /></a>Pretty nice view, eh?  That's a few minute walk from me...too bad there are smoke stacks in the picture.  Berlin might be a very beautiful city, but be under not delusion that it is not also an industrial / industrialized city.

Looking around, there's not much going on in this part of town.  Strangely enough, I feel more at home here than I do in NY, in terms of ethnic diversity.  It's no secret that I grew up in a pretty diverse area, and on the border of Kreuzberg (one of the immigrant hubs in Berlin), it feels a lot like home.  The Berliners don't really seem to care about the immigrant populations, but they also don't seem to want to go into Kreuzberg; I, however, found it to be pretty cool.

The weather here, like the people, is different.  When I got here, I figured that it would be nice and in the 80s or so, and I was right...but off by about 12 hours.  The morning before I arrived, it started to cool down from the heat wave that was Germany for the summer, and now we're moving into cooler temperatures...kinda a mis-estimation on my part as I brought with me no winter clothes (besides pants) and have flip-flops and tons of shorts.  But that's beyond the point.<a rel="attachment wp-att-92" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/04/no-i-do-not-speak-french/img_1864/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-92" title="Also outside my room..." src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_1864-400x266.jpg" alt="Also outside my room..." width="400" height="266" /></a>This is another view from outside my room -- it reads "no masters, no slave!", I think...  I'm not entirely sure what a "Herri" is, but I'm pretty sure it's in the range of Masters...it's Berlin-specific slang.  But that's beyond the point -- I love that my side of the street is proper and well-to-do (minus the furniture...this plastic, vinyl amalgamation from hell...it's funny but scary), and the other side looks like a great place to get drugs.<a rel="attachment wp-att-96" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/04/no-i-do-not-speak-french/img_1893/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-96" title="A Trabbi!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_1893-400x266.jpg" alt="A Trabbi!" width="400" height="266" /></a>And, finally, to top it all off, this is what is called a Trabbi: a soviet car.  I love how the car is actually so tiny, yet it's license plate reads "Big"...

And that's pretty much the general tour of my life in Germany to this point...  I've had plenty-a-chance to speak German, but I still have yet to go shopping to get food and to find soap....soap, how I need SOAP!  I'm kinda Germaning it (don't tell them I said that), but I'm avoiding the shower or just using really hot water when I do shower...ouch.

But after my first day, I'm starting not to feel so lost, at least not as lost as I did my first time in NY.  After dinner at a Turkish Schnell Imbiss (fast food place?), I'm ready for bed...so I leave you with our final stop of the day: the view from a war memorial from the Napoleonic Wars that overlooks most of Berlin.<a rel="attachment wp-att-98" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/04/no-i-do-not-speak-french/img_1929/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-98" title="A view from a memorial." src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_1929-266x400.jpg" alt="A view from a memorial." width="266" height="400" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

Love the little Trabbi.  That appears to be a beautifully restored Trabant.  We saw them all over Budapest and the Czech Republic last year.  (did you know:  "In medieval German Trabant meant foot soldier or personal guard?"  Source:  Wikipedia, which you can never believe, anyway).   I think you look very French, mien herr.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I've been here a few days now, and what I thought would originally be a restful time has become even more exhausting than summer...  We've been moving constantly since we got here, and we've had almost not time to ourselves.  It's insane.

NYU has been hustling us around on tour after tour after tour, and when we get back, it's been too late to go out and do things, and we're all too tired to go out and do things anyway.  Blah.  I mean, for the first couple days, we got back so late that we couldn't even go and buy food.  Seriously, now?  I thought being abroad would make me less sick of NYU, yet I am now more sick of it than ever.

Anyway, here is the main building for the school I am going to be "studying" at during my stay here in Berlin: Humbolt-Universität zu Berlin.<a rel="attachment wp-att-107" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/06/the-sights-and-no-sleep/img_1935/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-107" title="The front of Humbolt" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_1935-400x266.jpg" alt="The front of Humbolt" width="400" height="266" /></a>Yeah, but anyway...  Down the street from our school resides a museum, a church / cathedral, the Fernsehtrum (television tower), and the prettiest department store I ever did see -- it puts all department stores in the states to shame.<a rel="attachment wp-att-108" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/06/the-sights-and-no-sleep/img_1966/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-108" title="The cathedral down the street from the school and the Fernsehturm" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_1966-400x266.jpg" alt="The cathedral down the street from the school and the Fernsehturm" width="400" height="266" /></a>The weather, as you can see in this picture, has been a bit off lately -- it will rain early in the morn, and then randomly clear up as the day goes by.  It's kinda annoying.  I was preparing for hot weather for a few months, and I'm greeted by rain, but hey, it's supposed to warm up this week.<a rel="attachment wp-att-109" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/06/the-sights-and-no-sleep/img_1980/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-109" title="Pleasure Garden" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_1980-400x266.jpg" alt="Pleasure Garden" width="400" height="266" /></a>And this sign says "at the pleasure garden" -- that sounded so good at the time.  After the longest and most painful lunch I've ever endured, hands down, we took a long walking tour that lasted far too long...  I mean, we covered less than 1/2 mile, but the guide was talking for so long that, after about 10 minutes, not 1 single person was paying attention, and we were all fading in and out of consciousness.  I mean, c'mon NYU -- there are a bunch of tired, jet-lagged students who can barely keep their eyes open, so what's the next logical step?  Ah, of course, drag them around the city and drone on and on about some historical something or the other in the background whilst our eyes glaze over...ugh.

And since, by the time we got home it was too late to do much shopping (we did managed to get some food), we decided that we were going to make Spätzle.  One of our friends brought a Spätzle press with her, so we gave it a shot.<a rel="attachment wp-att-110" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/06/the-sights-and-no-sleep/img_1999/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-110" title="Our dinner!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_1999-400x266.jpg" alt="Our dinner!" width="400" height="266" /></a>Oh yeah...  But anyway -- I have a bunch of crap to get done...

Adieu!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Again, NYU, in their infinite wisdom, took us on a FREAKING LONG trip to Potsdam.  I mean, it was gorgeous, but at the same time, I was exhausted...again.  I mean, the day before classes start, why do we take a trip that lasts all day and wears us out even more?  Are they trying to make sure that we'll sleep during the night?  That's not a problem in the slightest.  Seriously, just leave us alone...please.  But anyway, I shall stop complaining...for now...not really.

Ugh, so much for any remnant of a break I thought I would have before classes start -- I was dragged around the city, much against my will, lost more sleep, and am now more tired than when I left the states...  And I have class now.  I give up.  I miss my puppy :(<a rel="attachment wp-att-22" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/07/potsdam/img_1551/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-22" title="Gracie sniffing me." src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_1551-266x400.jpg" alt="Gracie sniffing me." width="266" height="400" /></a>But anyway, we took a day trip to Potsdam -- for those who don't know, Potsdam is on the outskirts of Berlin and is where quite a bit of stuff that matters happened.  Glad that I could clear that up for you.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-119" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/07/potsdam/img_2027/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-119" title="The name of where we went" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2027-400x266.jpg" alt="The name of where we went" width="400" height="266" /></a>As you can see, Potsdam is very yellow.  Yes, very yellow.  Actually, you know what?  I'm too tired even to begin to think right now, so I'm just going to post a gallery and you can look around and such, I'm going to go collapse...I mean, you would really only miss a bunch of sarcasm if I continued writing right now, so pretend I was sarcastic, go have a nice laugh, and look at the pretty pictures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ahh, finally...a class that actually went well on the first day!  So, for my architecture class, we met at a little café behind Humbolt, and we discussed what the class was to be, introduced ourselves, and talked a bit about what we already knew of architecture (ie. I knew that buildings could stand...).   It was pretty cool -- we had our first class meeting in a coffee shop.  Anyway, once we got done with the basics, we headed right over to the Staatsbiblothek zu Berlin (The State Library of Berlin, the old one, at least) and went straight for the map section.  To say that these maps were old and amazing is a drastic understatement.<a rel="attachment wp-att-144" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/10/a-good-start/img_2259/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-144" title="Berlin in 1650" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2259-400x266.jpg" alt="Berlin in 1650" width="400" height="266" /></a>This little gem is a map straight from 1650 -- yes, it is an original map that was drawn in 1650.  To think that that used to be Berlin...  Also, if you look in the lower-lefthand corner of the map, you'll see two squares and line coming from it -- that is Unter den Linden Straße way back when it wasn't.  Back then, it was a path to the king's private hunting grounds...  Today, that is the center of Berlin.  Amazing how things change.<a rel="attachment wp-att-145" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/10/a-good-start/img_2262/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-145" title="Berlin when it had a wall" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2262-400x266.jpg" alt="Berlin when it had a wall" width="400" height="266" /></a>This map is from when Berlin grew a little bit: the green that looks kinda rigid and star-like is actually a wall that used to surround Berlin.  Notice that there are suburbs outside of the actual wall -- mainly, the King's stuff was protected, and some of the suburbs weren't even built yet, so there was no real need for a wall.  Anyway, weiter!<a rel="attachment wp-att-146" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/10/a-good-start/img_2265/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-146" title="American WWII map of the city" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2265-400x266.jpg" alt="American WWII map of the city" width="400" height="266" /></a>And, of course, what would a journey through Berlin be with WWII?  Yeah, this is a map from America of the key places to bomb (black) in Berlin -- I mean, not all of these were essential, they were just key areas.  And, finally, to put the damage of WWII into perspective, let's look at a German map from after the war.<a rel="attachment wp-att-147" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/10/a-good-start/img_2271/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-147" title="A German map of the damage to Berlin" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2271-400x266.jpg" alt="A German map of the damage to Berlin" width="400" height="266" /></a>I don't think I really even have to describe this map...dark = dead.  Ugh.

So yeah, that's what we did in my architecture class today -- we looked at maps to better understand how cities evolve and change over time.  Naturally, I didn't post all the maps we looked at, but these were the ones I thought were the coolest / most important.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So tonight, guess what!  Things went boom outside our window!  Oh yes!  You heard me right...<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">two, count them, 1, 2</span> 3 (apparently, I miscounted last night, there were really 3 cars that were torched) cars were set on fire by our apartment building tonight.  Well, it's 3:30am, and I just wanted to post an update...but what would an update be without photos?<a rel="attachment wp-att-167" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/14/and-in-the-midnight-hour/img_2304/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-167" title="The fire in front" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2304-400x266.jpg" alt="The fire in front" width="400" height="266" /></a>As you can see, there is a rather larger fire burning right outside the building next to ours.  This was two cars, we don't know what make, that were "randomly" set on fire, according to the NYU peoples.<a rel="attachment wp-att-166" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/14/and-in-the-midnight-hour/img_2301/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-166" title="Another shot of the front" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2301-400x266.jpg" alt="Another shot of the front" width="400" height="266" /></a>And another shot of the front...that's a fireman with a hose trying to put it out.

Now, in the back of the apartments, there was another fire...let's take a look.<a rel="attachment wp-att-168" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/14/and-in-the-midnight-hour/img_2311/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-168" title="The second fire...behind our building." src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2311-400x266.jpg" alt="The second fire...behind our building." width="400" height="266" /></a>I could hardly get a shot of it, but that's the fire in the back...another car.<a rel="attachment wp-att-169" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/14/and-in-the-midnight-hour/img_2315/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-169" title="The Students" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2315-400x266.jpg" alt="The Students" width="400" height="266" /></a>And these are only some of the displaced students (only temporarily, they're all back in their rooms).<a rel="attachment wp-att-171" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/14/and-in-the-midnight-hour/img_2322/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-171" title="Firemen at the burned car" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2322-400x266.jpg" alt="Firemen at the burned car" width="400" height="266" /></a>And once the fire was out, this is the fireman trying to get the hood of the car open to make sure that the engine still wasn't on fire.<a rel="attachment wp-att-170" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/14/and-in-the-midnight-hour/img_2320/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-170" title="Police Van" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2320-400x266.jpg" alt="Police Van" width="400" height="266" /></a>And last but not least...the police van that is now still blocking traffic to our street.

For this post...sorry about the horrible...everything, it's 3am, I was awoken because I couldn't breathe in my room (the smoke and crap was THAT thick), I still feel all the smoke and stuff, and now I'm trying to write...yeah, been a crazy night.  Well, at least I got some pictures of this.

Ahhh...bed time again.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So on my way to class today, I saw something I found amazingly hilarious:<a rel="attachment wp-att-178" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/16/high-quality-architecture/out/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-178" title="Bricks in the Building" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/out-400x300.jpg" alt="Bricks in the Building" width="400" height="300" /></a>You see, as the building was getting older, parts of it started falling apart (look at the bottom of the column, it's missing both sides), and someone thought it would be entertaining to fill some of holes with Legos.  This is actually a Humboldt building (the university I'm studying at), so the building easily dates to turn-of-the-century, possibly a lot earlier.  Normally they try to repair the buildings as they get older, but this is just priceless.]]></content:encoded>

We saw a story about the artist who fills in cracks in old buildings with Legos on Euromaxx on German TV.  His name is John Voorman and he goes all over the world adding Legos to cracks in buildings, walls, walkways, and other structures as a form of street art.  You can see the snipet about him by following this link:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So we went to Hamburg yesterday...  It would have been an awesome day, but we had to get up at 6:30 in order to get to the train station on time to catch our train there...ugh.  Most of the day was a constant fight to stay awake, and the rest of the day consisted of playing a game on my cell phone so that I could actually stay awake.

Our day started off with a mini-tour of the city that consisted of seeing 2ish buildings and then going to a lecture.  Now, the lecture would have been very interesting, I'm sure, if I could have managed to stay awake during all of it, and during the lecture is when I found the game on my cell to keep my from falling asleep.  But more on that later...

To get to Hamburg, we took the ICE -- Inter-city Express.  Unlike most trains in the US, this one is actually fast.<a rel="attachment wp-att-184" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/19/hamburg/img_2344/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-184" title="Our Speed" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2344-400x266.jpg" alt="Our Speed" width="400" height="266" /></a>Well, not as fast as a plane, but still pretty fast.  Anyway, once we got to Hamburg, as I said, we went on a mini-tour.  Here is what we saw:<a rel="attachment wp-att-185" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/19/hamburg/img_2349/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-185" title="The Center" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2349-266x400.jpg" alt="The Center" width="266" height="400" /></a>And then we took a really long walk to a lecture...  As I said, I found a game in order to keep me awake during the lecture.  Normally, I have no problem staying awake for boring things, but I could hardly pull it off today.  I was so freaking tired from waking up early that I needed something to do: I found a really cool and addictive balance game on my phone.  Rather than trying to stay awake by putting a painful expression on my face and focusing (Holly), I decided to hold my phone in my lap and play (it only required one hand as my phone has accelerometers), and I would nod occasionally...and hey, I stayed awake!

After the lecture, we took a nice stroll back to the center of the city, and we were let free.  On the way there, though, we did see a really nice lake:<a rel="attachment wp-att-188" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/19/hamburg/img_2374/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-188" title="A Lake" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2374-400x266.jpg" alt="A Lake" width="400" height="266" /></a>And we were constantly reminded, whenever crossing a street, that we <em>really</em> should not go.<a rel="attachment wp-att-187" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/19/hamburg/img_2364/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-187" title="Be sure not to walk" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2364-400x266.jpg" alt="Be sure not to walk" width="400" height="266" /></a>Those crazy Germans... And, it gets even better!  We were walking back to the city center, along the lake, and I saw one of the most adorable dogs in the history of dogdom and stuff.  I mean, well, look!<a rel="attachment wp-att-189" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/19/hamburg/img_2392/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-189" title="That's too big for him!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2392-400x266.jpg" alt="That's too big for him!" width="400" height="266" /></a>Yes, he is carrying a stick that is about 2-3x his size, and he seems so happy and cheerful to be doing it.  He was so proud of himself for carrying the stick, and everyone was stopping to take pictures...it was just adorable.

Anyway, once we were back to the city center, we were set free, and we walked around the little lakelett once again.  On the way, we ran into some other NYU kids there, and we sat with them, this is what happened:<a rel="attachment wp-att-191" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/19/hamburg/img_2411/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-191" title="Kevin?" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2411-400x266.jpg" alt="Kevin?" width="400" height="266" /></a>I'm not entirely sure what he was trying to do, but we came to the general conclusion that he looked like Beeker from Doug.  Yeah, it was a strange day...<a rel="attachment wp-att-192" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/19/hamburg/img_2417/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-192" title="Kevin, again" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2417-400x266.jpg" alt="Kevin, again" width="400" height="266" /></a>And it just kept getting stranger..especially when Kevin took it upon himself to get his toe bitten off by that ducky-swany-goosey thingy there.  Too bad he survived...

On another note, I like cheese.

And on a completely different note, this is the same evil bird as before, but this picture just looks a bit cooler, I think.<a rel="attachment wp-att-193" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/19/hamburg/img_2419/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-193" title="Someone's Feet" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2419-266x400.jpg" alt="Someone's Feet" width="266" height="400" /></a>So I'm running out of things to say, so let's just take a look at the view we had from where we were sitting along the lake.  I mean, it would have been a lot better if the sun weren't destroying ours eyes / my lense, but that's how it goes.<a rel="attachment wp-att-190" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/19/hamburg/img_2410/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-190" title="Another part" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2410-400x266.jpg" alt="Another part" width="400" height="266" /></a>Anyway, one final thought from Hamburg...at least, one final thought on the day that almost put me to sleep...  <a rel="attachment wp-att-186" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/19/hamburg/img_2354/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-186" title="WWI Memorial" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2354-266x400.jpg" alt="WWI Memorial" width="266" height="400" /></a>And that was about 1,000 words right there.  The memorial is to WWI, and it reads: "40,000 of the sons of the city gave their lives for you (ya'll)".  And with that, I'm out of depressing things to say...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, it was laundry day today, and instead of paying for my laundry...I did it by hand...  Now, let me explain why: Normally, I would do 2 loads of laundry, that comes out to 2 wash cycles and 2 dry cycles.  Normally, that costs me $4; here, however, laundry costs 3€ a load, so that would come out to 12€, which is $17.60.  In other words, doing laundry here is not an option, and even if I did, the washing machines are quite a bit smaller than in the US, so I would end up doing more and paying even more money.<a rel="attachment wp-att-198" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/20/laundry-day/img_2436/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-198" title="Laundry in Tub" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2436-400x266.jpg" alt="Laundry in Tub" width="400" height="266" /></a>And that's all of my clothes soaking away in their own filth.  When I went to drain the water, I couldn't see through it...yum!<a rel="attachment wp-att-199" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/20/laundry-day/img_2438/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-199" title="Hanging" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2438-400x266.jpg" alt="Hanging" width="400" height="266" /></a>And that's half of my stuff hanging...<a rel="attachment wp-att-200" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/20/laundry-day/img_2441/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-200" title="In the Living Room" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2441-400x266.jpg" alt="In the Living Room" width="400" height="266" /></a>And that's the other half...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So today, we felt like taking a mini-trip down to the Zoological Garten in Berlin, and besides not being that pretty, it also wasn't that much fun.  I mean, the entire time there, I heard more English that I did German, and the sights were also not that spectacular.  And, before we left, some asian girls pointed out a couple that was having sex in the bushes.  Yes, it was...weird.

Anyway, since I don't have much to say about this...enjoy the gallery![gallery]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I was more or less told that I couldn't be in class today...well, sorta.  You see, I'm getting sick, and since everyone is afraid of le swine flu, if we are feeling sick, we are not to be around others / in class.  So I ended up going home today.  Fun.

But anyway, I figure this is noteworthy: my laundry just finished drying today.....yes!!

And, finally, here is a picture of our street at night (gotta love tripods!):<a rel="attachment wp-att-216" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/23/and-scene/img_2471/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-216" title="Street at Night" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2471-400x266.jpg" alt="Street at Night" width="400" height="266" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So on Sunday, rather than going back to Oktoberfest (I had had enough of it by that point), I took a nice walk down through the Englischen Garten.  To say the least, it was one of the most beautiful places I have ever been.  The garten, if you don't know, is split into two parts that are a bit separated from each other.  I started in the top half and worked my way down.  In the middle of the two sections, I came upon one of the coolest art projects I have ever seen:<a rel="attachment wp-att-264" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/my-day-out-englischer-garten/img_3029/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-264" title="Art" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3029-400x266.jpg" alt="Art" width="400" height="266" /></a>Yep, it's an entire mural made out of backpacks.  BACKPACKS!  It was brilliant and beautiful.  I mean, those Germans really do know how to do their art.  As I continued walking, I came upon a bitter-sweet landmark: Hitler's former house in Munich.  I mean, it is amazingly beautiful, but at the same time, it's kinda...well, Hitler...<a rel="attachment wp-att-265" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/my-day-out-englischer-garten/img_3034/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-265" title="Hitler's House..." src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3034-400x266.jpg" alt="Hitler's House..." width="400" height="266" /></a>It looks absolutely amazing, but at the same time...ugh.

On a brighter note, once I was actually to the garten, things just got even more and more beautiful.  I mean, this garten was, to say the least, a park.  And it put our parks to shame.  To shame!<a rel="attachment wp-att-269" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/my-day-out-englischer-garten/img_3102/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-269" title="The View" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3102-400x266.jpg" alt="The View" width="400" height="266" /></a>That was in the middle of the garten, just hanging out there.  I was in the middle of the field just sitting and reading.  I have to say, this was one of the best days that I have had in a VERY VERY LONG time.  It was peaceful, the weather was perfect, the people were quiet.  It was absolutely incredible.  And it gets even better...wait for it!<a rel="attachment wp-att-266" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/my-day-out-englischer-garten/img_3059/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-266" title="Puppies!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3059-400x266.jpg" alt="Puppies!" width="400" height="266" /></a>Dogs!  Everyone brought their dogs here and let them run around.  It was adorable.  I mean, I was sitting there reading, and there were puppies running all around me.  I was in dog heaven.

After I finished my reading, which I drew out to a couple of hours...whoops...I decided to take a walk around the park and see what else there was out there to see.<a rel="attachment wp-att-272" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/my-day-out-englischer-garten/img_3044/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-272" title="A Scary Sign" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3044-400x266.jpg" alt="A Scary Sign" width="400" height="266" /></a>I mean, even if you don't speak German (click the image to get a translation), you can tell what this sign is trying to tell you.  But I guess it got its point across: I was not going to go swimming.  But still, if you would have seen the water (wait for it), you really would have wanted to go swimming...and boy was I tempted.<a rel="attachment wp-att-273" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/my-day-out-englischer-garten/img_3048/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-273" title="A Mini Waterfall" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3048-400x266.jpg" alt="A Mini Waterfall" width="400" height="266" /></a>I mean, I was at an FKK (told you I would get to it!), the water looked amazing, and no one would have cared if a naked guy was swimming in it.  But then again, I didn't want to die...so alas, no swimming for me.  But as I continued to walk around, I came across some cooler stuff, still.<a rel="attachment wp-att-268" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/my-day-out-englischer-garten/img_3088/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-268" title="Coolest Dog" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3088-400x266.jpg" alt="Coolest Dog" width="400" height="266" /></a>This dog was so intent upon catching a duck that he refused to leave the water.  You can't see it here, but his two front paws were in the water, and he was just staring.  Trying to coerce a duck into coming his way.  He failed.  Poor puppy.<a rel="attachment wp-att-270" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/my-day-out-englischer-garten/img_3123/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-270" title="The Dog, again" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3123-400x266.jpg" alt="The Dog, again" width="400" height="266" /></a>And later, as I was finishing my walk, the same dog came up to me, and unlike the other dogs in Europe, he stuck his nose in my lap and asked me to pet him.  He was so amazingly adorable.  But back to my wanderings.  Did I mention how perfect this place was?  Don't believe me?  Take a look at this:<a rel="attachment wp-att-274" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/my-day-out-englischer-garten/img_3078/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-274" title="A Horse Carriage" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3078-400x266.jpg" alt="A Horse Carriage" width="400" height="266" /></a>Is that not a scene from a movie?  I mean, she's so happy to be giving this family a carriage ride, and the kid is so happy to be talking to her.  It was just awesome.

And wait, it still gets better.  Yes, better!<a rel="attachment wp-att-271" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/my-day-out-englischer-garten/img_3132/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-271" title="A Horse" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3132-400x266.jpg" alt="A Horse" width="400" height="266" /></a>What you see here is a horse.  What you don't see is the owner of the horse training him.  And if you look closely enough, you'll see naked people in the background, but we can just ignore that for now.

Finally, I just want to show one last thing that I thought was adorable and seriously put the finishing touches on this garten.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, this post is password protected for numerous reasons:
<ol>
	<li>I am not happy</li>
	<li>I am very aggravated</li>
	<li>I'm going to be destroying a lot of people</li>
	<li>I don't like most of these people</li>
	<li>These people should not be reading this post</li>
</ol>
That being said, let's let the wholesale destruction of my NYU compatriots begin!

So, for starters, let's just see how bad this trip went:

When we first got on the train for München, things were looking pretty good.  We had our seats, we had our nice train beds, and the people were friendly.  That should have been my first indication that something was going to go wrong.  When we got to München, the morning was beautiful, the weather was perfect, and the scenery and even prettier.  That should have been my second indication that something was going to go wrong.

So we finally got around to getting to our Hostel: we got there way too early, no one could check us in.  No biggie -- we took a nice walk.  But when we got back to the Hostel, they hadn't received our request to cancel two beds...that was fun...eventually they canceled them, but it was fun, nonetheless.

When we finally got around going out to Oktoberfest, we noticed that our return train tickets were gone. Gone. Gone.  Yes, they were gone.  Somehow, Greg had lost them.  Wtf?  We had to go to the train station, get in line, and talk to some official who simply didn't care, pay 8€ extra for a reprint, and then have Greg try to blame me for losing the tickets from HIS bag.  Needless to say, I took the tickets from him afterward and kept them with me.  Imagine that, they were fine with me.

But don't worry, it still can get worse, and it does.  So when we finally get to the Oktoberfest area, Greg is convinced that he is master of the world.  Fuck. No.  All he wants to do is tell me I'm wrong, argue with me about insignificant details, and prod at my sarcasm simply because he thinks I'm serious.  It's absurd.  Anything and everything I said from when we got off the train until we got to back to Berlin, he was criticizing and arguing against.  I just wanted to tell him to STFU, but I didn't.

So after a little while, I just started to ignore him, and when he finally hit the spot (telling me I was wrong about how the Internet works...this was the same guy who didn't know was a Browser is), I just kinda went off, told him to shut his mouth, that he didn't know what he was talking about, and he was just blatantly wrong and making himself sound like a moron.  I could have been meaner, but I have to live with guy for the rest of the semester. Fun.

But anyway, after that ordeal (which was a summary of the entire weekend with him in a few paragraphs), even more happened.  Aside from his bickering, he got even stupider.  Oh yes, I said it, he gots more stupider!  So when we were in the tent the first day, Greg took it upon himself to drink everything and anything in sight.  It was disgusting.  Before the sun had even hit the horizon, he was so plastered that he passed out on the table.  Now, this normally wouldn't have been a problem, but the people at the table were uncomfortable with him there and were asking me to move him.  So I did.  I made him stand to try to get a little more back into it...he refused and stayed seated.  Then he threw up everywhere.  Just...everywhere.

Security came and escorted him from the tent, and he ended up on the back lawn, drunk.  WTF?  I have nothing more to say...well, except that he threw up twice more on the way out.  His lack of self control was....annoying, to say the least.

But still, get this, by the end of the weekend, not only had he spent all the money he brought with him, he was on the phone with his mother complaining about how he had no money left, as though she was the irresponsible one who blew 80€ on beer, and at least 40€ on crap food...in 1 weekend.

Now, you're probably think that that is not all that bad.  Well, as you know, I like to follow the rules (except when they're rules that explicitly need to be broken), and I'm not too keen on breaking ones that I agree with.  So, Saturday night, the tents were packed and closed.  No surprise, it was a Saturday night at the biggest beer fest in Europe.  The morons from NYU were convinced that we had to get into a tent, or a Biergarten, at least.  Now, these were, by this point, reservation only, and security was standing there making sure that only people with reservations could get in.

What did they do?  Sneak past security.  Now, like I said, I don't like breaking rules like this.  So after watching them get caught trying to sneak by about 2-3 times, I just left.  Walked away and didn't even look back.  Idiots.

And another reason this post is password protected: I don't want them to know where I went that night :-P

By the time they noticed, I was pretty much out of the fair grounds, and I refused to answer my phone / respond to texts.  I was fed up with them, so I decided to go do what I felt would be the best use of my time: see the city.  All I can say is that I am so glad that I left them behind, because I had such an awesome time walking around and seeing the sights at night.  It was breathtaking and beautiful.  And I shall share with you some of what I saw now.<a rel="attachment wp-att-299" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/its-a-secret/img_2981/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-299" title="A department store" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2981-266x400.jpg" alt="A department store" width="266" height="400" /></a>Let me frame this picture for you.  Mirmer is a department store.  That's right.  This building is a STORE.  Incredible, eh?  You know what else is cool?  How downtown Munich turns into a social and artsy place at night.  Withing about 2 blocks of each other, there were two bands performing: one all female, the other all male.  The females were playing very classical and pretty music, and the males were trying to put pop into classical music, and doing quite well at that.<a rel="attachment wp-att-300" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/its-a-secret/img_2984/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-300" title="A really good street band" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2984-400x266.jpg" alt="A really good street band" width="400" height="266" /></a>And now for the males...<a rel="attachment wp-att-303" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/its-a-secret/img_3001/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-303" title="Another really good street band" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3001-400x266.jpg" alt="Another really good street band" width="400" height="266" /></a>They were both very entertaining, and I have to say that I wish I would have stayed a little longer to listen to them.  But I didn't and alas, we move forward.<a rel="attachment wp-att-301" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/its-a-secret/img_2987/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-301" title="The building with pedo bear" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2987-266x400.jpg" alt="The building with pedo bear" width="266" height="400" /></a>This building is, I believe, the city hall in Munich.  This is also the building that is home to pedo bear.  He can be found on the left side of the middle tower...but he can't be seen in this picture, sadly.  And this building, strangely enough, was one of the few buildings that was actually really old: most of them were made to look modern and ugly.

However, I'm glad to see that the spirit of Munich lives on:<a rel="attachment wp-att-302" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/its-a-secret/img_2993/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-302" title="Poetry and Truth (and good wine)" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2993-400x266.jpg" alt="Poetry and Truth (and good wine)" width="400" height="266" /></a>I saw this little store right around the corner from the town hall, and I had to get a picture: "Poetry &amp; Truth: Good Books, Good Wine".  Oh yeah, go Germans.  "Of course I drink wine with my poetry, what am I, British?!"

And we continue even further...well, I'm kinda running out of things to say at this point, so let's just look at something that I kinda miss right now:<a rel="attachment wp-att-305" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/its-a-secret/img_3007/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-305" title="The city I thought I had left" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3007-400x266.jpg" alt="The city I thought I had left" width="400" height="266" /></a>Yep, New York -- you can't escape her, no matter where you go.  She is always there...kinda like herpes...hmm.

And, finally, for the end of this post, let's look at some artsy stuff.  First of all, let's look at something that is really pretty: these were just hanging inside of some covered walkway, and I just thought they would make an awesome picture:<a rel="attachment wp-att-304" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/its-a-secret/img_3006/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-304" title="Some cool hanging things" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3006-400x266.jpg" alt="Some cool hanging things" width="400" height="266" /></a>Turns out I was right...

Outside the city hall, too, there was a really cool fountain.  At night, correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like an old man's hair dangling from the last remnants of his scalp there.<a rel="attachment wp-att-306" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/its-a-secret/img_3011/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-306" title="A cool fountain" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3011-400x266.jpg" alt="A cool fountain" width="400" height="266" /></a>Or perhaps I'm just crazy...

And, finally, because I'm feeling a bit sentimental, I leave off with a rose.  A special, lone rose waiting there, forever, for someone.<a rel="attachment wp-att-307" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/its-a-secret/img_3015/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-307" title="And a rose..." src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3015-400x266.jpg" alt="And a rose..." width="400" height="266" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So after my extended stay in the Englischen Garten, I took a long stroll down through no where.  I just walked on for a while to see what was around, and then I kept on going.  First, right out of the garden, I came upon a type of squarey thingy that had a couple really large, old buildings in it.  I'm just going to put what I saw:<a rel="attachment wp-att-289" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/after-the-garten/img_3139/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-289" title="A big, scary LION!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3139-400x266.jpg" alt="A big, scary LION!" width="400" height="266" /></a>I mean, look at that.  It was...awesome.  I don't quite remember what he was supposed to be guarding, but that there was a lion just standing there in the middle of Munich was awesome.  I mean, he just looks so noble...

Anyway, aside for that there lion, there was a nice little park (the Munichers really like their parks and gardens) that I wandered to and sat down in.  Most of the people here were, interestingly enough, asleep.<a rel="attachment wp-att-290" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/after-the-garten/img_3142/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-290" title="Sleeping people in another park." src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3142-400x266.jpg" alt="Sleeping people in another park." width="400" height="266" /></a>Those two didn't move the entire time that I was in the park.  They just stayed there. Dead.  But anyway, the rest of the park was really pretty, and people were giving me strange looks for having a really large camera with me, but it was completely worth it: got some really awesome pictures.

Once I left the park, I continued wandering towards the center of the city, and when I got there, I found something that was really surprising, especially for Berlin on a Sunday: a crazy religious guy yelling at the top of his lungs about all the problems that Germany was having without religion and whatever they yell about...like not having gotten laid in the past 40 years.  Yeah, that.  But he was just furious, and he had all sorts of signs with him, and yeah.

The interesting part about this is that it was election day in Germany.  He was a member of a tiny religious political party.  He was in Bayern (the religious part of Germany, he is to Berlin as Gemenon is to Caprica :-D), and people did not really like his religious sprouting.<a rel="attachment wp-att-291" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/after-the-garten/img_3147/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-291" title="An Angry Christian" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3147-400x266.jpg" alt="An Angry Christian" width="400" height="266" /></a>I was thoroughly entertained.  Though, I think what made this so much better was that there was a street performer not even 50 feet from him, and the street performer had a MUCH LARGER crowd than he had.  Here, look:<a rel="attachment wp-att-293" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/after-the-garten/img_3149/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-293" title="People ignoring the angry Christian" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3149-400x266.jpg" alt="People ignoring the angry Christian" width="400" height="266" /></a>That's just a small segment of the street performer's crowd.<a rel="attachment wp-att-294" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/after-the-garten/img_3153/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-294" title="The crowd that cared about the angry Christian" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3153-400x266.jpg" alt="The crowd that cared about the angry Christian" width="400" height="266" /></a>And that was his crowd...she the 1 guy even caring to look?  Yeah...  But it gets even better!  Let's see what some of his signs have to say...<a rel="attachment wp-att-292" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/after-the-garten/img_3148/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-292" title="The sign of the angry Christian" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3148-266x400.jpg" alt="The sign of the angry Christian" width="266" height="400" /></a>I don't think I even need to translate that...it's pretty straight foward, and you get the idea of what kinda of looney-bind we're talking about here.

So moving on, once people started ignoring him (ie. always), he quieted down.  Well, after a little while, at least.  But if you look here, I think I found something truly amazing in the architecture of the building he was standing in front of.  I mean, this is just incredible.<a rel="attachment wp-att-295" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/after-the-garten/img_3196/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-295" title="I found PedoBear!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3196-400x266.jpg" alt="I found PedoBear!" width="400" height="266" /></a>That, my friends, behind the pillar, is PedoBear (google him if you don't know him).  Let me put this in perspective for you: he is behind a doric column at the TOP of a huge, middle-ages building.  That's just kinda weird if you ask me.

I'm just going to let that one sink in.

Letting is sink.

Still sinking.

There, see what I mean?  Yeah, weird, eh?

So now that that has sunk in, I'm almost back to my Hostel, so I'm just going to show you one last thing that I found really cool: a street performer.  He wasn't your average street performer: he was clearly not a native German, he was sad, but at the same time, very Irish and happy.  It was interesting, and his dog was even more adorable.  I do have a picture of the dog, but I think a picture of him best suits this spot.<a rel="attachment wp-att-296" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/after-the-garten/img_3224/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-296" title="A street musician" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_3224-266x400.jpg" alt="A street musician" width="266" height="400" /></a>Like I said: awesome.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I guess the best way to start off is by running through the craziness that is Oktoberfest.  To start off, let me tell you how we got there and highly suggest that anyone traveling in Europe do the same: we took a night train and paid 15€ extra for beds...and it was worth it!  The train ride took 8 hours, but we were asleep the entire time...it was awesome.  Seriously, do it.

Anyway, when we got to München (Munich, for those English speakers out there), we were a few hours too early to check into the Hostel; I mean, 7am is too early for people during Oktoberfest?  Though it was rather entertaining -- we walked into the hostel at that time, the lights were off, the receptionist was asleep in the chair and looked like he was going to fall out of it, and people were passed out all over all the furniture.  It was amazing.

But since we were there so early, we decided to take a long walk down through the city until people were awake and we could check in, and we started wandering.  We went from the Hostel down the way through the city center.  Since it was still really early, absolutely no one was around, and we were free to wander.<a rel="attachment wp-att-227" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/arrival/img_2500/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-227" title="Something" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2500-400x266.jpg" alt="Something" width="400" height="266" /></a>I don't quite remember what this building actually is, but it is large and pretty and old.  Compared to everything else around it, this is by far the oldest building, even if parts of it have been restored.  It was really interesting, actually: in the center of the city, there were really only two really old buildings, and the rest were all modern, restored, and ugly.  I mean, classic architecture here just didn't exist.  Kinda sad...

But as we journeyed further through the city, we did start to find some cooler stuff that actually wasn't...well, this is just weird.<a rel="attachment wp-att-228" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/arrival/img_2519/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-228" title="Scary Sign!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2519-400x266.jpg" alt="Scary Sign!" width="400" height="266" /></a>I have no idea what this was doing in München.  I mean, SanFran coffee....really?  And then when you go to Frisco, you see nothing but Euro coffee.  Ugh.

So after some more extensive wandering, we finally came upon one of the greatest things, in my opinion, that München has to offer: its gardens.  They were completely and utterly amazing and beautiful.  Aside from all of the historical happenings in München, the gardens are the most impressive part.  As it was still really early in the morning, we didn't have much time to wander around, but we did get to take a stroll by a riverishly looking thingy.  But anyway, whilst wandering, let's see what we saw:<a rel="attachment wp-att-232" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/arrival/img_2507/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-232" title="Smiles!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2507-400x266.jpg" alt="Smiles!" width="400" height="266" /></a>This made me laugh uncontrollably.  Normally, I'm against graffiti, but I'm not sure if this is graffiti or art, but it's really cool (and you can see the river in the background).<a rel="attachment wp-att-233" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/arrival/img_2506/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-233" title="A lone leaf" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2506-400x266.jpg" alt="A lone leaf" width="400" height="266" /></a>And this was a poor little leaf that never quite made it to the large pond of life in which all is washed away and taken to...well, in this case, a waste processing and reclamation plant where water is purified for drinking, but if that weren't there, it would make it to the ocean of life!  But I digress...<a rel="attachment wp-att-231" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/arrival/img_2505/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-231" title="Naboo!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2505-400x266.jpg" alt="Naboo!" width="400" height="266" /></a>As we continued to walk, we started to see things appearing over the horizon of trees (yes, the city vanished behind the trees, take that Central Park!), and I saw this little beauty there.  I call him Naboo Jr. because he looks like a building straight from Naboo.  So, another digression: In Star Wars, the clone troopers or "Storm Troopers" are the equivalent of the Nazi SS, the Emperor is Hitler, Han is Han, and Lea is...not existent in real life, but that's beyond the point.  It appears that Lucas also modeled Naboo after the scenes here.  But now, back what I was talking about before....which was pretty much nothing.

Anyway, as we went further, the sun was coming up and we were getting ready to go back to the hostel to check in and the like.<a rel="attachment wp-att-230" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/arrival/img_2617/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-230" title="And a pig's head!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2617-400x266.jpg" alt="And a pig's head!" width="400" height="266" /></a>And on our way back through, I got a picture of a pig's head.  I'm not sure what this was doing in the city center, but it was kinda funny, so I snapped him.  And finally, because I can only say so much about a stroll in the morning without talking about Star Wars / Star Trek for the rest of the post, I'm just going to put up the last image and call it a morning...don't worry! there's another post exclusive for Oktoberfest coming up.<a rel="attachment wp-att-229" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/arrival/img_2616/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-229" title="Signs" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2616-400x266.jpg" alt="Signs" width="400" height="266" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So so so...I just got back from my first Euro Trip down to Bayern (Bavaria).  Just a slight warning: there are 6 blog posts to follow this one, and they go in chronological order: at top are the ones that happened first, and at the bottom are the ones that happened last.

There are tons of pictures, lots of talking, and 1 secret post ;)

Enjoy it...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Alrighty, so, Oktoberfest.  What can I say about that?  Well...it definitely was...

I guess the best place to start is from the beginning.  When we first go there, it was empty...I mean, I wasn't bumping into people, I could move freely, and things were great.  I got a few early morning shots, but nothing special...well, sorta.  In Germany, it's helpful to remember that you're not in America: you don't have moronic, god-loving, everything-else-hating religious radicals who will shoot someone and then say that the first commandment is "thou shalt not kill."  Anyway, with that in mind, it's also helpful to remember that Germans don't care about nudity or anything like it (more on the FKK later), and with that, I present what was atop one of the children's rides at Oktoberfest.<a rel="attachment wp-att-261" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/das-oktoberfest/img_2525/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-261" title="Naked Woman" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2525-400x266.jpg" alt="Naked Woman" width="400" height="266" /></a>Freaking priceless, isn't it?  Yes, that is a naked woman atop a ride that was built for 5 year olds.  Go Germany!

Anyway, after our first initial tour, we went to meet one of Greg's friend in the middle of the city -- it was fun, nothing to write home about.  So after we returned to the grounds, we met up with a few other people from NYU in one of the tents.  By the time we got there, one of them was already so drunk that he could hardly stand up, and it was even more entertaining because he hardly knew where he was.  Well, he knew he was at Oktoberfest, but he didn't know much else.  Priceless.

As I was looking around the tent, I got some nice pictures of some of the people there, including one girl who was having way too much fun at 12 (yes, he was drunk by 12).<a rel="attachment wp-att-250" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/das-oktoberfest/img_2609/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-250" title="Some girl..." src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2609-400x266.jpg" alt="Some girl..." width="400" height="266" /></a>Awww, doesn't she look so happy?  And no, I have no idea who she is, but I'm pretty sure she was sitting at our table for a little while there.  Anyway, aside from that, I guess I shall just get this out of the way: I only had 1.5 beers my entire time at the fest.  Yep, 1.5.  At 8,50€ a beer, I decided that it was better not to blow everything I had on...beer.  What am I, Homer?  Well, there actually was a guy there who could probably rival Homer:<a rel="attachment wp-att-252" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/das-oktoberfest/img_2644/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-252" title="Crazy Thin Guy" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2644-400x266.jpg" alt="Crazy Thin Guy" width="400" height="266" /></a>See those three marks on his left arm?  That's a count of the number of beers he had drunken so far.  Notice the ceiling of the tent?  It was still light out (around 5ish), and he'd gone through three beers.  By the end of the night, he had AT LEAST 9 beers, 2 joints, and a couple shots of cocaine.  It was amazing that he didn't just die...and I have to say, he was still quite a bit more sober than a lot of people in our group, and considerably smaller, too.

Speaking of drunks, as the day wore on, more and more NYU people started showing up, and soon it turned into a crazy American dance party with our own DJ, DJ Taylor!<a rel="attachment wp-att-253" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/das-oktoberfest/img_2791/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-253" title="Taylor...on stage" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2791-400x266.jpg" alt="Taylor...on stage" width="400" height="266" /></a>The band in the tent actually called her onto stage to direct, and let's just say she did an awesome job...granted, she had no idea what she was doing.  In this picture, I say that the band messed up and she was frustrated, but in reality, she was so lost up there.  I love it.

After she got down, let's just take a look at how much she had been drinking during that time, and then maybe you'll understand what really happened.<a rel="attachment wp-att-254" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/das-oktoberfest/img_2837/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254" title="Taylor...that drunk!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2837-400x266.jpg" alt="Taylor...that drunk!" width="400" height="266" /></a>Actually, that would have probably killed her.  That's a collection of a FEW of the beer glasses that were on our table when we took this picture.  Good times.

After the initial drinking, dancing, and the like, I continued to take pictures of the festivities of the night, that is, of course, until my roommate got so drunk that he threw up everywhere and was escorted from the tent by security.  Oh yeah, it was incredible.  Incredible, I tell you.<a rel="attachment wp-att-255" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/das-oktoberfest/img_2844/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-255" title="Greg...drunk" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2844-400x266.jpg" alt="Greg...drunk" width="400" height="266" /></a>I don't have a picture of security actually taking him out, but that's a picture of him floating on the clouds, laying on the back lawn where security threw him.  When I got there, I took his wallet and camera -- he didn't need drunken pictures, and I wasn't going to let him buy any beer.  What I love about this picture is that his glasses are missing.  He left them inside.  Just left them...  So yeah, I just kinda told him to eat the pretzel, left him with 3€ for water, and went back inside (btw, he spent the water money on a ride...I'm glad I didn't leave his wallet).

About 20 minutes later, I'm not entirely sure how, he managed to show up back inside...meh...  Since he was plastered, he fell asleep on the table and just kinda got lost in the night.

The rest of us, however, were still having a great time.  Everyone was dancing, most people were on the benches jumping up and down, and I have pictures!<a rel="attachment wp-att-257" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/das-oktoberfest/img_2915/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-257" title="Annie" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2915-266x400.jpg" alt="Annie" width="266" height="400" /></a>That's Annie, kinda moving in the light, kinda not.  She was not standing, for some reason, but insisted on sitting down and dancing.  It was rather entertaining.<a rel="attachment wp-att-259" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/das-oktoberfest/img_2937/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-259" title="Annie and her Friend" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2937-400x266.jpg" alt="Annie and her Friend" width="400" height="266" /></a>And that is her standing on the bench and dancing.  The guy over her shoulder makes me laugh -- he's at Oktoberfest and looks surprised at something he saw.  Oh well.<a rel="attachment wp-att-258" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/das-oktoberfest/img_2936/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-258" title="Kevin" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2936-400x266.jpg" alt="Kevin" width="400" height="266" /></a>And this is Kevin pretending to dance.  It's an awesome picture, though...  Or maybe he was saying that he really is a superstar, who knows?

Anyway, I kinda danced the night away, and when I finally left, my legs were beyond sore.  No, sore implies that they hadn't fallen off yet.  They were killing me.  I mean, not much else happened -- I don't really want to go into detail about how I danced and all that, for I'm sure it would kill you, so I shall just leave it at that.

After we left the tent, Kevin and Shevani decided that they wanted to go on a ride, so we kinda followed them around, and waited.  Now, here is a cool picture that took me about 20 tries to get -- they were on a very-fast-spinning ride, and I couldn't get it just right, but this was the closest I got:<a rel="attachment wp-att-260" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/09/28/das-oktoberfest/img_2979/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-260" title="Kevin and Shevani" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_2979-400x266.jpg" alt="Kevin and Shevani" width="400" height="266" /></a>I love the partial blur in the picture and how everything is kinda moving besides their car.  As you can see, Kevin looks terrified (in the back), and Shevani is having a blast (in the front).

After that, we just went home and died.  Not much else going on that night: rampant drinking, dancing, making fools of ourselves, and too many pictures.  I consider that night a success.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Aditi in Berlin</title>
		<link>https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/04/aditi-in-berlin/</link>
		<pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2009 14:27:14 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://clovar.com/blog/?p=346</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So Aditi came to visit me in Berlin, and this is what happened:<a rel="attachment wp-att-347" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/04/aditi-in-berlin/img_3279/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-347" title="Communist Takeover!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3279-266x400.jpg" alt="Communist Takeover!" width="266" height="400" /></a>It was amazing...Aditi arrived in Berlin, and the communists just...appeared.  Yeah, she seems to have that effect on people.

Anyway, the day was just a bunch of sight-seeing, touring, and my giving historical context to things that we were seeing around the city (followed by a quiz as we walked back past all of the places I showed them).  Anyway, as we were walking around, we went to see some pretty stuff at night, and we came across this square: we saw it in my architecture class, but I don't remember what the buildings in it are for / from.<a rel="attachment wp-att-349" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/04/aditi-in-berlin/img_3324/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-349" title="In front of some pretty building" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3324-400x266.jpg" alt="In front of some pretty building" width="400" height="266" /></a>And it figures that I just had to get the picture right as the lighting of the building was white: it was changing colors randomly, and white was the worst color on it.  And then, another building (to the left of this shot).<a rel="attachment wp-att-350" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/04/aditi-in-berlin/img_3338/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-350" title="Another pretty building" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3338-400x266.jpg" alt="Another pretty building" width="400" height="266" /></a>And again, white on this building.  I mean, c'mon Germans, we get that you once tried to be Aryan, but this is ridiculous...

Beyond that, I have not much to say for the day -- the only people who would really care to hear about the day were there, so I feel kinda weird retelling...<a rel="attachment wp-att-348" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/04/aditi-in-berlin/img_3316/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-348" title="It was...hot" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3316-400x266.jpg" alt="It was...hot" width="400" height="266" /></a>Just like retelling why this picture was taken...you would have had to have been there.<a rel="attachment wp-att-351" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/04/aditi-in-berlin/img_3347/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-351" title="Aditi NEVER stopped moving" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3347-400x266.jpg" alt="Aditi NEVER stopped moving" width="400" height="266" /></a>Or to understand why Aditi never stopped moving...would have had to have been there.<a rel="attachment wp-att-352" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/04/aditi-in-berlin/img_3352/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-352" title="Between a rock and a hard place." src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3352-400x266.jpg" alt="Between a rock and a hard place." width="400" height="266" /></a>Or why I felt it necessary to scale the side of the stones in the Holocaust Memorial...have had to have been there.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, for my last architecture assignment, we had to take a really long walk down to the middle of no where and beyond!  Seriously, we left at 2:30 for there and we got back at 8:30.  It was painful.<a rel="attachment wp-att-360" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/08/schlos-glienicke/img_3460/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-360" title="Disbelief" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3460-400x266.jpg" alt="Disbelief" width="400" height="266" /></a>See where they are pointing?  That is how far we had to walk.  We seriously could have just taken the bus that entire distance, gone 200 feet, seen the palace, and returned.  But no.  We walked for hours, wondering what was what, and all the while wondering if we were ever going to find it.

It was insane.

But, if we look beyond the actual assignment, we actually have a bit of fun before / after we were there.  Before we got there, we had 1 hour to wait for one of our buses, and there was a park nearby...here's what happened:<a rel="attachment wp-att-356" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/08/schlos-glienicke/img_3379/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-356" title="Happy Kevin and Jenny" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3379-400x266.jpg" alt="Happy Kevin and Jenny" width="400" height="266" /></a>Both of them were far too happy, simultaneously!  It's like a pokémon attack...but wait!  There's more!<a rel="attachment wp-att-357" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/08/schlos-glienicke/img_3392/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-357" title="Hope Attack!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3392-400x266.jpg" alt="Hope Attack!" width="400" height="266" /></a>Order in the next 15 minutes, and we'll also include Hope's "Sneak Attack" at no extra charge!  That's right, you heard me right, I have no idea what I'm talking about!  Seriously, I've lost everything this week, and it doesn't look like it's going to get any better.

On another note, as we were walking around, I did get some pictures.  Let me just sum up the entire experience for you in two pictures...give me a sec:<a rel="attachment wp-att-358" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/08/schlos-glienicke/img_3416/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-358" title="The Courtyard" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3416-400x266.jpg" alt="The Courtyard" width="400" height="266" /></a>And...<a rel="attachment wp-att-359" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/08/schlos-glienicke/img_3435/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-359" title="Some Entrance" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3435-266x400.jpg" alt="Some Entrance" width="266" height="400" /></a>And that was the entire coolness of that "palace."  But anyway...

That assignment was just kinda weird and all stretched out and awkward.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Andrew, 

How LUCKY you are that, while other students are SITTING in stuffy classrooms, you are out and about in Berlin visiting wonderful, old buildings.  

I copied the info below off the internet.  It provides come context for Schloss Glienicke, even though I'm sure that your teacher told you all of this and more. 

"Schloss Glienicke (Glienicke Palace) is a little piece of Italy in Berlin. It is part of the ensemble of parks, gardens and palaces created by the landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenné – a successful attempt to unite nature, art and architecture in a "Prussian Arcadia".
In 1825, at the behest of Prince Carl von Preussen, the neo-classicist architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel converted the original palace into a summer residence in the Italian country-house style. Elements of Classical and Byzantine art and architecture are integrated into the palace and its gardens, underlining its Mediterranean character. A large fountain in front of the main façade is decorated with gilt lions, it was modelled after the Villa Medici fountain in Rome. The gardens also feature a host of smaller buildings, such as the Hothouse and Orangery, the Hunter's Lodge, the romantic Klosterhof (cloister yard), the Matrosenhaus (mariner's lodge), the Gardener's House and the Machine House. A walk through this park is like a journey through the landscapes of Europe; one moves from the Alpine forests and gorges of the northern end to the "Mediterranean" landscape of the south. Here, the terraces of Schinkel's neo-classical Kasino offer a wonderful view of the Havel waterscape – "the Bay of Potsdam".
Directly behind the palace, we find a testimony to more recent European history: the Glienicker Brücke bridge, which crosses the Havel to connect Potsdam with Berlin. The bridge has been rebuilt several times in its long history; the original wooden construction was replaced by a bascule bridge, before Schinkel replaced this in turn with a neo-classical brick construction. In 1905, a modern construction, also divided in the middle, took its place, with further decoration being added in 1909. During the Cold War, the Glienicker Brücke bridge between West Berlin and the GDR became internationally famous as the place where spies were exchanged. "

SOURCE:  www.berlin-tourist-information.de

Here's some more context.  Later in the 19th century, about 50 years after Schloss Glienicke was built, Italian architecture became all the rage in the U.S., too.   This was during the so-called "Victorian" period.  A style of Victorian house called the "Italianate Victorian" evolved copied many features of the villas of Italy.  People in cold climates dream of the warmth of Italy.  Building homes that resemble Italian villas helped them imagine they were living in Italy's languid, temperate, sensual climate, rather than cold, snowy Berlin or New England.

Love, AP]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So todayish, we went for a nice trip of an old Brick Kiln outside of Berlin, but when we got there, it had already started raining, and the temperature was dropping down nicely into the 30's.  It was amazing.  Now, I thought that it would be a nice day, even beyond the weather, that is, until I was told that I was not allowed to take pictures.  I dragged my camera on an hour train ride just to be told that I'm not allowed pictures.  What, was I going to steal how they were making breaks?  Revolutionize their technique?  I mean, I would never be able to find <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2121365_make-bricks.html" target="_blank">these</a> <a href="http://www.shol.com/agita/thespiel.htm" target="_blank">links</a> on the <a href="http://www.howtopedia.org/en/How_to_Make_Bricks_-_Assessing_the_Technical_Problems_of_Brick_Production" target="_blank">internetz</a>.  But anyway, we weren't allowed pictures, so I have nothing really cool to show of the day.  However, because the temperatures were dropping down to some unhuman levels, I do have a few other things to share from the day.

At the start, like I said, it was getting cold: In NY, the winters are more of a dry cold than a wet one (some people will disagree, but the humidity is daily around 100%), and then add rain to that, then add 30km/h winds, and we have freezing people.  Yeah, I wasn't prepared for how harsh the winters are here...wait, it's still fall.  Oh geez.

But as we were walking around, they felt like stopping us outside to talk to us -- bad choice.  After about 2 minutes, I don't think that anyone was actually paying attention anymore because we were all too cold.  But that's beyond the point...bricks were being made.  Well, at least to them, our coldness was beyond the point.

Once we actually got inside, we warmed up a bit, but no pictures from that.  And then we went on a nice walking tour of the installation -- there was not much to show from the day, but we did get to go inside one of the actual kilns / furnaces in which the bricks were made.  It was pushing 40c in there, and it was amazing.  We were all just hoping that we would never have to leave...but alas, we did, and we were pushed back out into the cold.

Now, normally this wouldn't be too bad altogether, but it gets worse...  Later that day, we met again to go for yet another tour of architecture stuffs.  I mean, this was altogether really cool, but at the same time, we were exhausted and didn't actually want to do that.  Eh, that's just life, I guess.

And now that this post is nice and boring and without any pictures, I shall leave it there.

Tschüß!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So we had another day trip to the city of Weimar.  It was beautiful.  It was freaking cold.  I am still kinda cold from it.  Joy.  Now, let me put this trip into perspective for you: a lot of us, the day before, went to the Brick Kiln and then had class and were still amazingly exhausted from all of that.  Then we had to get up and be ready to leave by 7:10 in the morning, otherwise we would miss our train.  Then we had a really long train ride down there, and a fast tour of the area (really fast, we walked by it; later in the day, we got more information (read: we were told 1 fact), and that was that).  The entire day consisted of going to Goethe's House in Weimar, which was beautiful.

When we got to Goethe's house, we were given a walking tour of the house (I walked around it at least 4 times in total), and then Stefan, who studied Goethe extensively, gave us his own tour of the house in which we described how the house functioned with Goethe's theory of color.  It was awesome.  For this part of the tour, I wasn't allowed to bring my camera along, so I have nothing really cool to share, but I do have pictures of the next part!  Well, I guess I can show you the color wheel:<a rel="attachment wp-att-375" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/16/weimar/goethefarbkreis/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-375" title="Goethe's Color Circle" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/GoetheFarbkreis.jpg" alt="Goethe's Color Circle" width="307" height="320" /></a>I would talk about it...but I don't feel like it.

Anyway, after our quick walk through downtown, which consisted of looking at 1 building, we continued our tour down to Buchenwald.<a rel="attachment wp-att-376" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/16/weimar/img_3495/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-376" title="Goethe and Schiller" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3495-266x400.jpg" alt="Goethe and Schiller" width="266" height="400" /></a>Now, this was only a concentration camp, not actually an extermination camp, so it's not as bad as it sounds...but it was still pretty bad.  Now, I feel even worse about saying this part: it was so cold out there that I could not focus on what the tour guide was saying and remember almost nothing of what happened, so I don't have much to write about, but I do have pictures of stupid Americans to show...but that comes later!

First, let's take a look at parts of Buchenwald.  I mean, at least the parts that I got pictures of...and don't judge me for what I write here...it's kinda insensitive, but I was exhausted and didn't want to do anything: the definition of college life.<a rel="attachment wp-att-377" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/16/weimar/img_3510/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-377" title="Our Tour Guide at Buchenwald" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3510-266x400.jpg" alt="Our Tour Guide at Buchenwald" width="266" height="400" /></a>This was our tour guide.  This is a picture of her outside, in the cold.  This is me not caring.............................

And still cold.................

And tired................

I'm a horrible person.

[caption id="attachment_378" align="aligncenter" width="400" caption="&quot;To each his own&quot;"]<a rel="attachment wp-att-378" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/16/weimar/img_3524/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-378" title="Entrance to the Camp" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3524-400x266.jpg" alt="Entrance to the Camp" width="400" height="266" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: left;">And this was the entrance to the camp -- the sign is backwards because it was meant to face the prisoners.  It reads, "To each his own," meaning that it was the prisoner's own faults that they were there.  It's sick.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyway, once we got inside, we stood in the cold for a little while more until nothing more existed but cold.  Allow me to demonstrate what I got from the tour:<a rel="attachment wp-att-379" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/16/weimar/img_3528/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-379" title="The View from Buchenwald" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3528-400x266.jpg" alt="The View from Buchenwald" width="400" height="266" /></a>That was the view from the top of the hill at Buchenwald.  I'm not sure what else to say.  Like I said, I'm a horrible person and far too tired to care.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyway, as the day was coming to an end, we all were gathered in the train station waiting for our late train, and a few interesting things happened.  First, I got carded while buying alcohol.  That's right: carded, in Germany, while buying alcohol.  She thought I was 14.  And she couldn't read my Cali ID card.  Wow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Second, the Americans were making a fool of themselves playing games in the train station. I include three pictures here for posterity's sake.<a rel="attachment wp-att-380" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/16/weimar/img_3533/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-380" title="Crazy Americans" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3533-400x266.jpg" alt="Crazy Americans" width="400" height="266" /></a>Being really loud...<a rel="attachment wp-att-381" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/16/weimar/img_3535/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-381" title="Crazy Americans, Again" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3535-400x266.jpg" alt="Crazy Americans, Again" width="400" height="266" /></a>Becca dancing...<a rel="attachment wp-att-382" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/10/16/weimar/img_3536/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-382" title="Crazy Americans, Again 2" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/img_3536-400x266.jpg" alt="Crazy Americans, Again 2" width="400" height="266" /></a>And more general debauchery...</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After 3 days of long classes and tours, I was so exhausted that I figured the only logical thing to do was go clubbing.  I'm glad you're following my logic.  Yep, after waking up really early to get to classes a few mornings in a row, it became necessary to go clubbing really late at night so that I wouldn't be able to wake up the next day (today...now).

The night started off pretty well -- I was bored before leaving, so I went over to Sarah's room with a bottle of wine, 3 cookies, tons of chocolate (Ritter, if you must know!), and pre-made tea, as well as our matching tea mugs that we bought that day.  Yeah, I don't know why everyone thinks we're married, but I must say, I really do like our nickname now: Andarah.  Sounds spacey!

I guess I should give a rundown of this whole thing: at NYU in Berlin, we have couples forming left and right, and when they do, we give them nicknames of both of their names to address them because they're pretty much joined at the hip and it's easier that way.  Now, Sarah and I are not dating, for obvious reasons, and it's still pretty funny that we're now an "official" NYU in Berlin couple, thanks to the nickname.  But anyway...

I brought over a bunch of stuff, and we just kinda collapsed onto the couch talking and watching the <em>strangest</em> German TV show I have ever seen.  I mean, imagine this: American Idol with a controlled crowd that practiced synchronized clapping, a beauty pageant, a hidden camera show, a folk singing show, a grocery-store checkout line novel, and celtic music.  It was...crazy.

So, after a bottle of wine, Sarah didn't have any, I was sitting on the couch with Google open calculating my BAC and how much more it was safe for me to drink.  According to Sarah, I'm such a nerd.  Guilty as charged.

But after a while, I was already pretty gone, and we decided that that would be a good time to leave.  Sarah insists that I tell everyone -- that night, apparently I was the drink vacuum.  She would make a drink, put it down, I would pick it up, and then it was gone.  Yeah, so I was finishing everything for her, and she was practically sober.  Whoops.

So when we finally got to the first place, I was already pretty gone, and it was pretty much only German that I could speak.  Well, could or would...not sure.  As we went in, it was a short admission fee, and then we just kinda gathered in the back.  It was supposed to be retro night, but it felt more communist retro than anything: everyone was too afraid to do anything because the Stasi might show up.  That about summarizes their choice of music.

At this club, pretty much all I remember is talking to everyone and not being able to stand up properly; Holly said it was finally good to see me drunk.  Well, ok, everyone said that.  And after about an hour, that place started getting a bit boring, and we decided that we were going to go a different club just a little ways away.  Now this is where the story get embarrassing.  Apparently, on the way there, I was only speaking German, and when I did speak English, I had an accent and couldn't really control it...  I don't remember having an accent, let alone an Irish one, but everyone tells me I did.  Oh well.

At this club, when we finally got there, they carded us again.  I look like a baby, apparently.  But once we got in, got our coats checked, and the like, the dancing began.  I'm not sure how long I was dancing, but it was a long time.  Let's see, it was a circle of Sarah (!), Liliana, London, and Greg.  Yeah, we were all just kinda dancing together and going crazy.  Not much to say behind that...but apparently the music was VERY loud and I was complaining about it for a while.  I mean, I remember that to speak to someone, I had to yell it in their ears.

Anyway, as the night was winding down, I had taken my shirt off and was dancing in my undershirt that I had worn that day (and then Sarah tried to get me to take my undershirt off...).  I'm leaving out some of the detail to spare your innocence, but yeah.  I don't know how long we were there, but I do remember that we got home at 6:30 in the morning.  My first time out clubbing, and I didn't get home until the sun was about ready to rise.  Good times.

But yeah, clubbing was the perfect end to 3 full days of getting up early and going on trips.  It was perfect.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, for one of our architecture classes, we had to go down (to the river, took a little walk, I met up with some turkeys, and we had a little talk; I washed that turkey, hung him on the line, and said we can take those turkeys, oh any old time!...oh RYLA!) to the outskirtsish of Berlin and photograph a theatre by night.  These are the pictures I took:<a rel="attachment wp-att-399" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/08/berliner-schaubuhne/img_3537-hdr/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-399" title="Stage Left" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_3537.hdr-400x266.jpg" alt="Stage Left" width="400" height="266" /></a>This is the left of the theatre...<a rel="attachment wp-att-400" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/08/berliner-schaubuhne/img_3543-hdr/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-400" title="Stage Right" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_3543.hdr-400x266.jpg" alt="Stage Right" width="400" height="266" /></a>The right...<a rel="attachment wp-att-401" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/08/berliner-schaubuhne/img_3547-hdr/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-401" title="Stage Front" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_3547.hdr-400x266.jpg" alt="Stage Front" width="400" height="266" /></a>The front...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So Cindy came to visit me in Berlin, and aside from doing all the normal stuff (running around, seeing the sights, sleeping too much, etc), we also went to Mauerfall (but more on that later).

Anyway, right before she left, she left a note on my door:<a rel="attachment wp-att-410" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/10/cindy-in-berlin/img_3889/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-410" title="Note from Cindy" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_3889-400x266.jpg" alt="Note from Cindy" width="400" height="266" /></a>Normally, I wouldn't post stuff like this, but I found it incredibly hilarious, especially since the Putzfrau (the maid who changes our sheets bi-weekly) came in and saw that on my door before I did.  Essentially, I find this so funny because, though her name is Cindy, it looks like she signed it "andy", so the Putzfrau thought that I slept with some random guy who "had an awesome time" and left before I woke up.  Good times.  Good times.

Thank you, Cindy.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I have decided to start a new blog category that I loving call "Deubnerisms."  Essentially, our EU Politics professor has said some hilarious stuff, and I just thought it would be great to share it with everyone.

To start off, let's go through some of the older things that he's said and just catch everyone up.

First day of class:
<blockquote>I detest being called "Doobner," it's "Doibner." (It's a German name, and that's how it's said.)</blockquote>
Sometime back in September, Markus asked him if he was a translator for the EU:
<blockquote>No, I am not a translator; translators serve a <em>purpose</em>!  <strong>I</strong> write policy!</blockquote>
And on my midterm, I wrote "The policy process is generally free in this stage...", and he <em>corrected</em> it to:
<blockquote>"The policy process is generally free<strong>ly</strong> in this stage..."</blockquote>
And from en email, we still don't know what this means:
<blockquote>Please do not render 'collective' papers. Even if you produce a text together, I prefer to see the individual contributions.</blockquote>
And another email (yes, this was the entire email):
<blockquote>Dear students of integration,

TEST</blockquote>
Yeah...it's such an incredible class.  Tehehe.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So we went out tonight, Sarah and I.  It started with dinner at this little Pizza, Pasta, and Wok place down in Kreuzberg, and it ended with a taxi ride home.

The movie was altogether not too great -- I mean, you can't write a tragedy by killing all the people who should be kept alive.  What was going on with that?  Did you really think that you could make a point by this?  All of the people who are trying to be moral are killed in horrible accidents.  Ugh.  In other words, wait until this hits the discount bin before renting it.

And back from our detour to film critic...I would say more, but I doubt anyone wants to read it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I went to Scotland this weekend.  That's right, you heard me: I returned to the land of the Scots this past weekend.  Now, I'm not entirely sure where to start this story, so I'm going to do the only logical thing and start it from the end: man, that was an awesome trip and I'm exhausted.  Hope you enjoyed it all!

...

Kidding, let's start from the beginning.  It all began with a small little bang -- well, really a sort of big bang that led to the universe still expanding as it did today.  Jump forward a few billion years, and you have me sitting on a Ryan Air plane, crammed in like a sardine, waiting for takeoff.  I wish I remembered the flight, but I was too busy sleeping.  I guess that made the flight better.  But when we finally landed, we started off towards our <em>hotel</em> -- screw those hostels, we had a <em>hotel.</em>

Our first encounter with the Scots was, to say the least, amazing.  You know, in New York, if you talk to someone on the street, you're likely to get a goodbye in the form of "Have a nice day, asshole," but here, everyone was happy to help us, they were friendly, charming, and lovely.  When we asked for directions, they would stop their entire day, look around with us, ask us how we were, and then get going.  It was great.

At the hotel, they were even friendlier.  The receptionist spent a good 20 minutes going through the sites with us, looking up where the banks were, finding bus schedules, and etc.  I mean, that man was so happy to help us and so kinda all the while that I just wanted to hug him and take him home with me.  In his words, he was "brilliant, excellent, and awesome."

Once we got everything checked in, we went and walked around and did some seeing -- I guess I should tell you where we were: Edinburgh.  It was such a beautiful city.<a rel="attachment wp-att-420" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-1/img_3964/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-420" title="Edingburgh Castle" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_3964-400x266.jpg" alt="Edingburgh Castle" width="400" height="266" /></a>Yeah, that's right...there is a freaking CASTLE in the middle of Edinburgh.  A whole castle.  Right there.  In the middle.<a rel="attachment wp-att-421" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-1/img_3988/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-421" title="More Edinburgh Castle" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_3988-400x266.jpg" alt="More Edinburgh Castle" width="400" height="266" /></a>I mean, it just goes on and on.  The above picture was taken as I was making my way up to the Royal Mile (I think it was called).  On my way up there, too, I found this road:<a rel="attachment wp-att-422" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-1/img_3997/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-422" title="Something all the Scots have" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_3997-400x266.jpg" alt="Something all the Scots have" width="400" height="266" /></a>Oh yeah, apparently, this is actually kinda common in Scotland.  Our tour guide was telling us about his Herpes, gonorrhea, and the like...it was kinda disturbing and WAY too much information.  But yeah, this is the name of an actual street on the way up to the center of the city.

Anyway, let's get away from STDs...our first day in Edinburgh was pretty uneventful as we were pretty exhausted from getting there, but we still had it in us to walk around.  Our first meal in the country consisted of, you guessed, it, Haggis.  At least my first meal, and almost every other meal, did.  Now, in case you don't know, Haggis is pretty much everything that is left over from the animals once they are done, stuffed in a stomach, and cooked.  In the modern day, there are more controls on this, and it's not that disgusting anymore, but that's the basic premise.<a rel="attachment wp-att-431" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-1/img_4010/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-431" title="My First Meal!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4010-400x266.jpg" alt="My First Meal!" width="400" height="266" /></a>Oh yeah, that's my hash, mash, and haggis.  And, if you look closely, in the corner, you can see my Caledonian/80 ale.  It was a perfect way to start the day.

Anyway, after lunch, we just did more walking until we came around to tour time.  I wish I could say the tour was informative, but it was just meant to be scary, and there was so much information in the tour that we could not process all of it.  Ugh.

Anyway, the tour started late at night and went into the underground areas of Edinburgh (which was pretty cool).  Here, we can see our tour guide making an example of one of the members; she later tried to hang him, but fail as she only had twine.  Oh well.  Serves him right for standing at the front of the tour as she was talking about hanging people.<a rel="attachment wp-att-427" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-1/img_4109/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-427" title="Our tour guide" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4109-400x266.jpg" alt="Our tour guide" width="400" height="266" /></a>I wish I could have gotten a picture of her, but she was always moving far too fast for me to get anything.  The lighting was too low, and I couldn't get a fast enough shot without flash and a horrible picture...oh well.  Her name was Faith, btw, just though I'd throw that in.

But I got way ahead of myself there...  Let's just jump back to some of the interesting things that the Scots do that we do not.  You know when a road is closed and we have to take a detour or an alternate route?  Not in Scotland!<a rel="attachment wp-att-426" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-1/img_4089/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-426" title="They &quot;divert&quot; their roads rather than have alternate routes" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4089-400x266.jpg" alt="They &quot;divert&quot; their roads rather than have alternate routes" width="400" height="266" /></a>They just throw up a diversion and hope you don't notice that the road is closed.  Smart.

And if that isn't enough, they'll get you drunk to do it!<a rel="attachment wp-att-423" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-1/img_3999/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-423" title="Expensive Whiskey" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_3999-266x400.jpg" alt="Expensive Whiskey" width="266" height="400" /></a>That's such a cheap bottle of Glengoyne if I do say so myself (£3750).

And, finally, some random pretty building because I'm out of stuff to talk about for the first day...  I mean, it was awesome but at the same time rather uneventful.<a rel="attachment wp-att-424" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-1/img_4003/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-424" title="Some pretty building" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4003-266x400.jpg" alt="Some pretty building" width="266" height="400" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, today consisted of a tour of the lowlands of Scotland, more specifically Stirling Castle, Loch Lomond, and Glengoyne Distillery.  For the first part of the tour, we made our way from Edinburgh to Stirling.  The trip was rather short, and the view that we got at the castle was incredible; I mean, you know how we have some nice views in America (or so we think)? Well, this put them all to shame...but I'm getting ahead of myself again...arg!  So, let's backtrack and start from leaving to Stirling...<a rel="attachment wp-att-436" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-2/img_4125/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-436" title="A view from the freeway of Stirling" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4125-400x266.jpg" alt="A view from the freeway of Stirling" width="400" height="266" /></a>This was our first glimpse of Stirling as we were rolling down the highway towards it.  Isn't is such a beautiful little Castle?  When I say little, perhaps I shouldn't...  I mean, Stirling Castle has been many a' pivotal point in Scottish history.  It has a gun battery that was used to defend the entire surrounding area, and it could dispatch of an aggressive force in, if I remember correctly, at best, 45 minutes.  Pretty much, if you took Stirling Castle, then you took Scotland.  It was never taken.

When we got to the Castle, we just did our little walking tour of it, but this is pretty impressive:<a rel="attachment wp-att-437" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-2/img_4145/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-437" title="Stirling Entrance" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4145-400x266.jpg" alt="Stirling Entrance" width="400" height="266" /></a>Those two towers, before the Castle was destroyed (I don't remember why it was destroyed) used to be 3x the height than they are right now.  Pretty impressive.  And if we look to the side of this, we can see the Royal Palace at Stirling:<a rel="attachment wp-att-439" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-2/img_4189/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-439" title="The Palace at Stirling" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4189-400x266.jpg" alt="The Palace at Stirling" width="400" height="266" /></a>If you look closely, you can see the vague remnants of the Royal Gold that used to be painted onto the building (essentially, Royal Gold was a color that <em>only</em> the ruling monarch of the time was allowed to use when building, and any building painted with it was royal.  In the right of the picture, you can see the actual color of Royal Gold and the main hall of the castle).

And, finally, for my last picture of Stirling, we have what I like to call the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Mouser_to_the_Cabinet_Office" target="_blank">Chief Mouser to Stirling Castle</a>" (click the link -- trust me, you will be glad you did).<a rel="attachment wp-att-438" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-2/img_4185/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-438" title="The Mouser of Sterling" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4185-400x266.jpg" alt="The Mouser of Sterling" width="400" height="266" /></a>Does he just look so adorable?!

After the castle, we went for a drive, got lunch, and on the way to Loch Lomond ended up at the castle where Monty Python and the Holy Grail was filmed...it was amazing!<a rel="attachment wp-att-440" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-2/img_4236/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-440" title="Monty Python Castle!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4236-400x266.jpg" alt="Monty Python Castle!" width="400" height="266" /></a>I know what you're thinking...I was thinking the same thing, too!  A little after this castle, we came upon a Highland Cow that we just had to take a picture of.  I mean, these aren't what we think of when we think cow.<a rel="attachment wp-att-441" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-2/img_4272/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-441" title="A Highland Cow" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4272-266x400.jpg" alt="A Highland Cow" width="266" height="400" /></a>Anyway, skip forward a little while, and we ended up at Loch Lomond (btw, Loch is the Gaelic (pronounced gah-lic) word for Lake).  I mean, I don't have much to say about this, save one thing: it was beautiful.<a rel="attachment wp-att-444" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-2/img_4355/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-444" title="From Atop" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4355-400x266.jpg" alt="From Atop" width="400" height="266" /></a>I mean, whilst here, I decided that this is where I want one of my Scottish houses to be.  Yep, right on an island in the loch.<a rel="attachment wp-att-442" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-2/img_4330/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-442" title="An Island" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4330-400x266.jpg" alt="An Island" width="400" height="266" /></a>Yeah, right there.  I want a house.  Yes, a house.  I want to live there.  I can't make this any more clear.<a rel="attachment wp-att-443" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-2/img_4342/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-443" title="Pensive Dave" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4342-400x266.jpg" alt="Pensive Dave" width="400" height="266" /></a>And this is Dave, just standing and staring off into the distance.  I was trying to silhouette him against the lake, but I failed.  Oh well.<a rel="attachment wp-att-445" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/17/scotland-day-2/img_4362/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-445" title="A Misty Morning" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4362-400x266.jpg" alt="A Misty Morning" width="400" height="266" /></a>Or I could have a house there...I'm not too particular.

But alas, this view had to end, so we decided to take a walk down a not-well-known path to where we were meeting.  Now, when I say "walk down," I might or might not mean slide on my butt down part of it, and I might or might not mean fall onto a tree with my knees and bruise my leg.  But hey, that's all just speculation.  And I never did get to take a picture of that little bird...but my camera lens might or might not have hit the ground as I slid while trying to take a picture of him.

Fast forward a little while, yet again, and we ended up at Glengoyne Distillery in the Highlands.  We had a sample of Scottish Whiskey while we were there (I found it to be disgusting), and we had an interesting conversation with the Germans on our tour.  Sadly, no picture of this were really allowed...so I have nothing to show besides more damage to my liver.  And that pretty much sums up that day.

In summary...it was beautiful.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I could give you a great history of the Fall of the Berlin Wall (Mauerfall) and all that great and wonderful stuff, but I'm just going to refer you to the best source of all information in the universe: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauerfall" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.

Now that you're thoroughly informed, I feel that I can tell you about how Gorbachev was made fun of: the announcer ask Gorbi to explain what he did in terms of the Wall coming down, and Gorbi went on for...geez, 5-10 minutes, then the announcer concluded with "thank you for rushing yourself."  And the night before, at the rehearsals, the announcer said "and now, we're going to listen to Gorbachev ramble on about incohrerent nonsense, and then we'll cut to you!"

But anyway...there's not much to say about the night, so I'm just going to attach a gallery so that you can see for yourself what I saw: I was standing relatively close to a jumbotron, and I could see nothing that was really going on besides that...

Oh! Though it is worth noting that Gordon Brown is one of the biggest, most arrogant leaders in the world: "Britain is and always will be the heart of Europe."  He got booed.  Understandably.

And, of course, the video clip from Obama silenced the crowd and got the biggest applause and cheering out of any of the foreign leaders present.[gallery]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, our last day in Scotland rolled around, and today was our tour of the Highlands!  The day, although consisting of seeing some very impressive and beautiful sights, was mainly composed of sitting on a bus and having stuff told to us as we drove by it.  Good times.

Anyway, the tour started off pretty slow...and I mean slow.  Here, take a look:<a rel="attachment wp-att-473" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/18/scotland-day-3/img_4387/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-473" title="Way Out" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4387-400x266.jpg" alt="Way Out" width="400" height="266" /></a>I do have to say, however, that I am now starting to understand that the differences between English and Germany are not merely because they are different languages: a lot of the strange things in German I saw repeated in the local Scottish Dialect of English.  It was rather fascinating, if I do say so myself.

The above sign, for example, was far more common than "Exit."  Indeed, "Way Out" is apparently how you indicate an exit in a building.  And offices are "To Let," not "for lease."  And you get food "for take away," not "to go."  Same(ish) in German.

But let's get to the tour...  The first mountain range we went through, we stopped at some mountains that...had something to do with history.  I just wanted to climb them.<a rel="attachment wp-att-474" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/18/scotland-day-3/img_4441/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-474" title="One of the Triplet Mountains" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4441-400x266.jpg" alt="One of the Triplet Mountains" width="400" height="266" /></a>Then we went on to this little place...I don't remember where...but it was a big lake (I think it was before we got to Loch Ness).<a rel="attachment wp-att-475" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/18/scotland-day-3/img_4461/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-475" title="A Cool Scene" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4461-400x266.jpg" alt="A Cool Scene" width="400" height="266" /></a>And then we ran into another cool scene...<a rel="attachment wp-att-476" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/18/scotland-day-3/img_4508/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-476" title="Another Cool Scene" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4508-400x266.jpg" alt="Another Cool Scene" width="400" height="266" /></a>And somewhere in there, we stopped at a WWII memorial...<a rel="attachment wp-att-477" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/18/scotland-day-3/img_4546/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-477" title="A WWII Memorial" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4546-266x400.jpg" alt="A WWII Memorial" width="266" height="400" /></a>But after all that, we finally got to Loch Ness!  At the start of our journey there, we stopped at a little castle (a destroyed one, too): Urquhart Castle.<a rel="attachment wp-att-478" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/18/scotland-day-3/img_4629/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-478" title="Urquhart Castle" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4629-400x266.jpg" alt="Urquhart Castle" width="400" height="266" /></a>Isn't it gorgeous?  In my opinion, Nessy destroyed it because we wouldn't stop looking for her.  Oh well.

Oh!  And did I mention how we found Nessy?!  Yeah, turns out she's saying "hi" to all the tourists these days...<a rel="attachment wp-att-479" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/18/scotland-day-3/img_4692/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-479" title="We found Nessy!" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4692-266x400.jpg" alt="We found Nessy!" width="266" height="400" /></a>Adorable, isn't she?  A bit smaller than I expected, though.

And then, we went further, and we finally got to Inverness (yeah, try saying that one: We were in Inverness).<a rel="attachment wp-att-480" href="https://clovar.com/blog/2009/11/18/scotland-day-3/img_4730/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-480" title="Inverness" src="https://clovar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/img_4730-400x266.jpg" alt="Inverness" width="400" height="266" /></a>To say the least, this tour was rushed, and I don't really feel that it was a good use of our time, but hey, at least now I can say that I've literally been around the <em>entire</em> country of Scotland.  In one day.  Ouch.

And finally, on this tour, they played this song <em>a lot.</em> It is such an awesome song that I just had to share:
<div style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="320" height="265" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vBKBI7DOLHA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="265" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vBKBI7DOLHA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Man...Deubner never ceases to amaze me with his masterful usage of the English language.
<blockquote>What will we be start with?</blockquote>
Well, I'm not sure, Deubner, but I think we will be start with...ouch!

And then, it gets so much better...we were talking about the Iron Curtain, and Deubner said, and I quote:
<blockquote>And the Iron Curtain stopped criminals from coming from the poor east to the rich west and running
their businesses here.  It was great.</blockquote>
He claims he was being sarcastic...but I'm not quite so sure.  Like I said, his English needs work, and he can't quite get sarcasm in English down...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yeah, so we had our Thanksgiving dinner the night before Thanksgiving (that's today, right?).  But aside from the food, I just wanted to tell you something that happened before we met for dinner.  The best way to tell this is to give you a quote from the email we received:
<blockquote>Today, we were confronted with a not-too-pleasant surprise: the restaurant at which the Thanksgiving dinner was supposed to take place had to cancel the arrangement because ... their kitchen had burnt out over the weekend (there's something going on with fire this semester ...).</blockquote>
And that pretty much describes it :-D]]></content:encoded>
