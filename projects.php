			This is an online game that I am currently developing.   It is based lightly on the world of BattleTech and what surrounds it.   As of now, I am mainly focusing on programming it, and later I will focus on the design.   There are still many bugs and much is left to finish, but it is coming along nicely.

			This was the final project for a class one semester.  I wrote the game entirely in assembly, using VGA, sound, and images to create what you see.<br />
            Naturally, since this was written entirely in assembly, the graphics leave a lot to be desired, and since I was also working with an 8080 processor, I was very limited in what I was able to.<br />
            The basic premise of the game is as follows: Wil Wheton (Wesley) has been kidnapped, and no one wants to rescue him, but you, a Star Trek fanboy, have stolen a Romulan Warbird and have set out to get him!
