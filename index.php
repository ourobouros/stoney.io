		Welcome to Clovar.com. Feel free to have a click around, look at my work, current projects, or anything else that interests you, and, if you are interested, don't hesitate to contact me for more information. I am presently available for a wide variety of projects and ideas.<br><br>
		My approach to web development differs largely from that of other companies: I do not attempt to force on you what you do not need, and I have no interest in ripping you off. I want you to have a website that you are happy to call your own, and I do not believe that it should cost a fortune. Furthermore, I have no interest in bogging you down with technical jargon if you are not interested in it: I can lay down in plain English everything that you need to know about your site. If you come to me with a general idea, I can turn it into a website without your having to know much about the overall designing and programming process.<br><br>
		My goal is to create a website for you that you will love to look at and love to use, one that suits your needs and wants perfectly, and one that simply works. It is your website, and it should be exactly how you want it, and this is what I strive to do. This I promise.
