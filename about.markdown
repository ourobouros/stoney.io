# Who is this Andrew Stone guy?

Well, you're probably most interested in the me I am now: presently, I'm working with a little
company called Clear Channel on their new [iHeartRadio](http://www.iheart.com/) web app. We have a few
other super-secret projects in the works, so keep a watch out for those announcements.

These days, I spend a great deal of my time working in javascript (quite the crazy little language,
if I do say so myself), and by night, I work in whatever language I feel like.  Take, for example,
this site: sure, there's a little javascript wizardry going on, but it's all
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) on the "backend" (and includes a few ruby plugins I've
written).

Or take a look at some of the other projects I've done.  I mean, I've been through python, c++, 
php, java, and even [lush](http://lush.sourceforge.net/), so there's no telling what I'll do next.
No, seriously, I don't really even know what I'm going to do next (it might not even be in English).
I know it will involve computers and stuff, but what it is...who knows.

# How do I contact him?

I'm sure you know what this is, no need to explain: <andrew@clovar.com>

And because I know you're going to ask:

1. No, I don't use twitter.
1. Yes, I am on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/114571747298983337712/)
