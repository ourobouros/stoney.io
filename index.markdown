# clovar, by andrew stone

No, it's not the newest fragrance in a line of bizarrely named, sexually-ambiguous scents for men,
women, dogs, or chinchillas.  In fact, it's not a scent at all.  In fact, it's not really much at all.
Clovar is, literally, for lack of a better domain, a word I decided would be fun to register.
I mean, getting my own name as the domain was next to impossible (yes, Andrew Stone, most generic
white-guy name ever (thanks Mom); John Smith and I are good friends).

# code, by andrew stone

It's what I do.  By day, a coding ninja, by night...well, you surely can't see a ninja at night.
