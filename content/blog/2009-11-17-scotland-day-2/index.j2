So, today consisted of a tour of the lowlands of Scotland, more specifically Stirling Castle, Loch Lomond, and Glengoyne Distillery. For the first part of the tour, we made our way from Edinburgh to Stirling. The trip was rather short, and the view that we got at the castle was incredible; I mean, you know how we have some nice views in America (or so we think)? Well, this put them all to shame...but I'm getting ahead of myself again...arg! So, let's backtrack and start from leaving to Stirling...{{ macros.img("img_4125.jpg") }}This was our first glimpse of Stirling as we were rolling down the highway towards it. Isn't is such a beautiful little Castle? When I say little, perhaps I shouldn't... I mean, Stirling Castle has been many a' pivotal point in Scottish history. It has a gun battery that was used to defend the entire surrounding area, and it could dispatch of an aggressive force in, if I remember correctly, at best, 45 minutes. Pretty much, if you took Stirling Castle, then you took Scotland. It was never taken.

When we got to the Castle, we just did our little walking tour of it, but this is pretty impressive:{{ macros.img("img_4145.jpg") }}Those two towers, before the Castle was destroyed (I don't remember why it was destroyed) used to be 3x the height than they are right now. Pretty impressive. And if we look to the side of this, we can see the Royal Palace at Stirling:{{ macros.img("img_4189.jpg") }}If you look closely, you can see the vague remnants of the Royal Gold that used to be painted onto the building (essentially, Royal Gold was a color that <em>only</em> the ruling monarch of the time was allowed to use when building, and any building painted with it was royal. In the right of the picture, you can see the actual color of Royal Gold and the main hall of the castle).

And, finally, for my last picture of Stirling, we have what I like to call the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Mouser_to_the_Cabinet_Office" target="_blank">Chief Mouser to Stirling Castle</a>" (click the link -- trust me, you will be glad you did).{{ macros.img("img_4185.jpg") }}Does he just look so adorable?!

After the castle, we went for a drive, got lunch, and on the way to Loch Lomond ended up at the castle where Monty Python and the Holy Grail was filmed...it was amazing!{{ macros.img("img_4236.jpg") }}I know what you're thinking...I was thinking the same thing, too! A little after this castle, we came upon a Highland Cow that we just had to take a picture of. I mean, these aren't what we think of when we think cow.{{ macros.img("img_4272.jpg") }}Anyway, skip forward a little while, and we ended up at Loch Lomond (btw, Loch is the Gaelic (pronounced gah-lic) word for Lake). I mean, I don't have much to say about this, save one thing: it was beautiful.{{ macros.img("img_4355.jpg") }}I mean, whilst here, I decided that this is where I want one of my Scottish houses to be. Yep, right on an island in the loch.{{ macros.img("img_4330.jpg") }}Yeah, right there. I want a house. Yes, a house. I want to live there. I can't make this any more clear.{{ macros.img("img_4342.jpg") }}And this is Dave, just standing and staring off into the distance.  I was trying to silhouette him against the lake, but I failed.  Oh well.{{ macros.img("img_4362.jpg") }}Or I could have a house there...I'm not too particular.

But alas, this view had to end, so we decided to take a walk down a not-well-known path to where we were meeting. Now, when I say "walk down," I might or might not mean slide on my butt down part of it, and I might or might not mean fall onto a tree with my knees and bruise my leg. But hey, that's all just speculation. And I never did get to take a picture of that little bird...but my camera lens might or might not have hit the ground as I slid while trying to take a picture of him.

Fast forward a little while, yet again, and we ended up at Glengoyne Distillery in the Highlands. We had a sample of Scottish Whiskey while we were there (I found it to be disgusting), and we had an interesting conversation with the Germans on our tour. Sadly, no picture of this were really allowed...so I have nothing to show besides more damage to my liver. And that pretty much sums up that day.

In summary...it was beautiful.
