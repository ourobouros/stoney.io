So, I finally did it -- that's right, I finally made it to Germany.  It took 13 hours of flying, 1 transfer, 3 meals, too much walking, and a cab ride, but I finally made it!  With my first trip through airport security, I almost took out one of those posts that says "do not cross" and wardens off a zone for TSA officers only...yeah, I didn't watch where I was going.  In my second trip through airport security (the Swiss don't trust American security, so we had to go through again -- and they didn't make me take my shoes off when I went through in Switzerland), and I must say, their security is quite a bit better than ours.  Not only did they have all sorts of other equipment that we're still debating how to pay for and if we're allowed to see under other people's clothes (let's just put it this way: I was one of the most-dressed people in the airport and I was wearing flip-flops, shirts, and a T-Shirt), but they were also using it! And, apparently, they think I'm French. When I first tried going through, the woman helping at the little X-ray belt thingy started speaking to me in French, so I told her in German that I speak German, and things got easier. Yes, apparently I look French, or all Americans speak French...I'm not sure.

But as I got through security, I waited at my little gate -- with a 45 minute transfer, much tighter security, a terminal transfer, and a delayed flight, I still got to my gate with a little over 30 minutes to spare. Say what you will about the Swiss (and their chocolate...they gave it to us on the flight, yay!), but they're efficient and good at what they do.

After another flight out of Switzerland, I finally made it to my place: Germany. From the airport, I took a cab to my apartment, and I'm not sure who looked more Californian, me or the driver... Oh, and the cab was also a BMW! Yeah, in Germany, things are a bit different.{{ macros.pimg("img_1863.jpg") }}But when I got here, things got awesome...okay, things got hurt. I'm not entirely sure what happened yesterday, but I was not really present for most of it. We went on a walking tour today, and let's just say that it has been many moons since my feet have killed like this...{{ macros.pimg("img_1878.jpg") }}And there is my room -- the black one on the left. Well, not really -- this is a squater village that is not too far from us. Awesome, eh?{{ macros.pimg("img_1867.jpg") }}This is really where I live -- Adalberstraße by Engeldamm. Our apartments are just a few hundred yards from the site where the old wall stood, which has now become a sunken garden (it used to be a canal, now they're doing something more with it).{{ macros.pimg("img_1894.jpg") }}Pretty nice view, eh? That's a few minute walk from me...too bad there are smoke stacks in the picture. Berlin might be a very beautiful city, but be under not delusion that it is not also an industrial / industrialized city.

Looking around, there's not much going on in this part of town. Strangely enough, I feel more at home here than I do in NY, in terms of ethnic diversity. It's no secret that I grew up in a pretty diverse area, and on the border of Kreuzberg (one of the immigrant hubs in Berlin), it feels a lot like home. The Berliners don't really seem to care about the immigrant populations, but they also don't seem to want to go into Kreuzberg; I, however, found it to be pretty cool.

The weather here, like the people, is different. When I got here, I figured that it would be nice and in the 80s or so, and I was right...but off by about 12 hours. The morning before I arrived, it started to cool down from the heat wave that was Germany for the summer, and now we're moving into cooler temperatures...kinda a mis-estimation on my part as I brought with me no winter clothes (besides pants) and have flip-flops and tons of shorts. But that's beyond the point.{{ macros.pimg("img_1864.jpg") }}This is another view from outside my room -- it reads "no masters, no slave!", I think... I'm not entirely sure what a "Herri" is, but I'm pretty sure it's in the range of Masters...it's Berlin-specific slang. But that's beyond the point -- I love that my side of the street is proper and well-to-do (minus the furniture...this plastic, vinyl amalgamation from hell...it's funny but scary), and the other side looks like a great place to get drugs.{{ macros.pimg("img_1893.jpg") }}And, finally, to top it all off, this is what is called a Trabbi: a soviet car. I love how the car is actually so tiny, yet it's license plate reads "Big"...

And that's pretty much the general tour of my life in Germany to this point... I've had plenty-a-chance to speak German, but I still have yet to go shopping to get food and to find soap....soap, how I need SOAP! I'm kinda Germaning it (don't tell them I said that), but I'm avoiding the shower or just using really hot water when I do shower...ouch.

But after my first day, I'm starting not to feel so lost, at least not as lost as I did my first time in NY. After dinner at a Turkish Schnell Imbiss (fast food place?), I'm ready for bed...so I leave you with our final stop of the day: the view from a war memorial from the Napoleonic Wars that overlooks most of Berlin.{{ macros.pimg("img_1929.jpg") }}
