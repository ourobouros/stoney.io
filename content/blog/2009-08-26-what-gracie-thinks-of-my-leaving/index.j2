So the poor puppy is kinda torn up that I'm leaving...she's been extra cuddly and close lately. I mean, I am really going to miss her, but at the same time, I'm completely looking forward to going forward and finding the new world! Err, old world! Err, across the pond! But anyway...Gracie seems just a bit annoyed that I would be leaving, see for yourself:{{ macros.pimg("img_1786.jpg") }}Doesn't she look so ferocious? Yeah, I didn't think so, either, but I didn't have the heart to tell her.

But on a completely different note, Marisa and I were talking about this really cool effect that we didn't know how to do with the camera a while ago. Anyway, long story short, the maiden in the castle is dead and Humperdink rules the land...well, sorta. Anyway, I finally figured out how to make that really cool shot happen:{{ macros.pimg("img_1683.jpg") }}As the description of the image says, I was able to accomplish this shot (granted the blur didn't come out exactly as I would have liked, but I'm still new!) by hitting the shutter button and zooming in on her at the same time. If the shutter speed was too slow, then all I got was blur, and if too fast, then a sharp image. Thus, in order to get this, I had to set my shutter to ~1/5 second and try to get something. This was my first real attempt at such an image, so I hope it didn't turn out too bad. I mean, the next one is a lot harder to look at...{{ macros.pimg("img_1685.jpg") }}And, finally, before I leave, there is one last picture of her I got...I'm not quite sure what it reminds me of, but the picture looks like one I've seen before.{{ macros.pimg("img_1670.jpg") }}
