So todayish, we went for a nice trip of an old Brick Kiln outside of Berlin, but when we got there, it had already started raining, and the temperature was dropping down nicely into the 30's. It was amazing. Now, I thought that it would be a nice day, even beyond the weather, that is, until I was told that I was not allowed to take pictures. I dragged my camera on an hour train ride just to be told that I'm not allowed pictures. What, was I going to steal how they were making breaks? Revolutionize their technique? I mean, I would never be able to find <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2121365_make-bricks.html" target="_blank">these</a> <a href="http://www.shol.com/agita/thespiel.htm" target="_blank">links</a> on the <a href="http://www.howtopedia.org/en/How_to_Make_Bricks_-_Assessing_the_Technical_Problems_of_Brick_Production" target="_blank">internetz</a>. But anyway, we weren't allowed pictures, so I have nothing really cool to show of the day. However, because the temperatures were dropping down to some unhuman levels, I do have a few other things to share from the day.

At the start, like I said, it was getting cold: In NY, the winters are more of a dry cold than a wet one (some people will disagree, but the humidity is daily around 100%), and then add rain to that, then add 30km/h winds, and we have freezing people. Yeah, I wasn't prepared for how harsh the winters are here...wait, it's still fall. Oh geez.

But as we were walking around, they felt like stopping us outside to talk to us -- bad choice. After about 2 minutes, I don't think that anyone was actually paying attention anymore because we were all too cold. But that's beyond the point...bricks were being made. Well, at least to them, our coldness was beyond the point.

Once we actually got inside, we warmed up a bit, but no pictures from that. And then we went on a nice walking tour of the installation -- there was not much to show from the day, but we did get to go inside one of the actual kilns / furnaces in which the bricks were made. It was pushing 40c in there, and it was amazing. We were all just hoping that we would never have to leave...but alas, we did, and we were pushed back out into the cold.

Now, normally this wouldn't be too bad altogether, but it gets worse... Later that day, we met again to go for yet another tour of architecture stuffs. I mean, this was altogether really cool, but at the same time, we were exhausted and didn't actually want to do that. Eh, that's just life, I guess.

And now that this post is nice and boring and without any pictures, I shall leave it there.

Tschüß!
