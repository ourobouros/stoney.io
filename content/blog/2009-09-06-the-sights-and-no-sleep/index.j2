So I've been here a few days now, and what I thought would originally be a restful time has become even more exhausting than summer... We've been moving constantly since we got here, and we've had almost not time to ourselves. It's insane.

NYU has been hustling us around on tour after tour after tour, and when we get back, it's been too late to go out and do things, and we're all too tired to go out and do things anyway. Blah. I mean, for the first couple days, we got back so late that we couldn't even go and buy food. Seriously, now? I thought being abroad would make me less sick of NYU, yet I am now more sick of it than ever.

Anyway, here is the main building for the school I am going to be "studying" at during my stay here in Berlin: Humbolt-Universität zu Berlin.{{ macros.pimg("img_1935.jpg") }}Yeah, but anyway... Down the street from our school resides a museum, a church / cathedral, the Fernsehtrum (television tower), and the prettiest department store I ever did see -- it puts all department stores in the states to shame.{{ macros.pimg("img_1966.jpg") }}The weather, as you can see in this picture, has been a bit off lately -- it will rain early in the morn, and then randomly clear up as the day goes by. It's kinda annoying. I was preparing for hot weather for a few months, and I'm greeted by rain, but hey, it's supposed to warm up this week.{{ macros.pimg("img_1980.jpg") }}And this sign says "at the pleasure garden" -- that sounded so good at the time. After the longest and most painful lunch I've ever endured, hands down, we took a long walking tour that lasted far too long... I mean, we covered less than 1/2 mile, but the guide was talking for so long that, after about 10 minutes, not 1 single person was paying attention, and we were all fading in and out of consciousness. I mean, c'mon NYU -- there are a bunch of tired, jet-lagged students who can barely keep their eyes open, so what's the next logical step? Ah, of course, drag them around the city and drone on and on about some historical something or the other in the background whilst our eyes glaze over...ugh.

And since, by the time we got home it was too late to do much shopping (we did managed to get some food), we decided that we were going to make Spätzle. One of our friends brought a Spätzle press with her, so we gave it a shot.{{ macros.pimg("img_1999.jpg") }}Oh yeah... But anyway -- I have a bunch of crap to get done...

Adieu!
