I guess the best way to start off is by running through the craziness that is Oktoberfest. To start off, let me tell you how we got there and highly suggest that anyone traveling in Europe do the same: we took a night train and paid 15€ extra for beds...and it was worth it! The train ride took 8 hours, but we were asleep the entire time...it was awesome. Seriously, do it.

Anyway, when we got to München (Munich, for those English speakers out there), we were a few hours too early to check into the Hostel; I mean, 7am is too early for people during Oktoberfest? Though it was rather entertaining -- we walked into the hostel at that time, the lights were off, the receptionist was asleep in the chair and looked like he was going to fall out of it, and people were passed out all over all the furniture. It was amazing.

But since we were there so early, we decided to take a long walk down through the city until people were awake and we could check in, and we started wandering. We went from the Hostel down the way through the city center. Since it was still really early, absolutely no one was around, and we were free to wander.{{ macros.img("img_2500.jpg") }}I don't quite remember what this building actually is, but it is large and pretty and old. Compared to everything else around it, this is by far the oldest building, even if parts of it have been restored. It was really interesting, actually: in the center of the city, there were really only two really old buildings, and the rest were all modern, restored, and ugly. I mean, classic architecture here just didn't exist. Kinda sad...

But as we journeyed further through the city, we did start to find some cooler stuff that actually wasn't...well, this is just weird.{{ macros.img("img_2519.jpg") }}I have no idea what this was doing in München. I mean, SanFran coffee....really? And then when you go to Frisco, you see nothing but Euro coffee. Ugh.

So after some more extensive wandering, we finally came upon one of the greatest things, in my opinion, that München has to offer: its gardens. They were completely and utterly amazing and beautiful. Aside from all of the historical happenings in München, the gardens are the most impressive part. As it was still really early in the morning, we didn't have much time to wander around, but we did get to take a stroll by a riverishly looking thingy. But anyway, whilst wandering, let's see what we saw:{{ macros.img("img_2507.jpg") }}This made me laugh uncontrollably. Normally, I'm against graffiti, but I'm not sure if this is graffiti or art, but it's really cool (and you can see the river in the background).{{ macros.img("img_2506.jpg") }}And this was a poor little leaf that never quite made it to the large pond of life in which all is washed away and taken to...well, in this case, a waste processing and reclamation plant where water is purified for drinking, but if that weren't there, it would make it to the ocean of life! But I digress...{{ macros.img("img_2505.jpg") }}As we continued to walk, we started to see things appearing over the horizon of trees (yes, the city vanished behind the trees, take that Central Park!), and I saw this little beauty there. I call him Naboo Jr. because he looks like a building straight from Naboo. So, another digression: In Star Wars, the clone troopers or "Storm Troopers" are the equivalent of the Nazi SS, the Emperor is Hitler, Han is Han, and Lea is...not existent in real life, but that's beyond the point. It appears that Lucas also modeled Naboo after the scenes here. But now, back what I was talking about before....which was pretty much nothing.

Anyway, as we went further, the sun was coming up and we were getting ready to go back to the hostel to check in and the like.{{ macros.img("img_2617.jpg") }}And on our way back through, I got a picture of a pig's head. I'm not sure what this was doing in the city center, but it was kinda funny, so I snapped him. And finally, because I can only say so much about a stroll in the morning without talking about Star Wars / Star Trek for the rest of the post, I'm just going to put up the last image and call it a morning...don't worry! there's another post exclusive for Oktoberfest coming up.{{ macros.img("img_2616.jpg") }}
