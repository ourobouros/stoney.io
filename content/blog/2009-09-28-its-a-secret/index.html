	<li>These people should not be reading this post</li>
</ol>
That being said, let's let the wholesale destruction of my NYU compatriots begin!

So, for starters, let's just see how bad this trip went:

When we first got on the train for München, things were looking pretty good. We had our seats, we had our nice train beds, and the people were friendly. That should have been my first indication that something was going to go wrong. When we got to München, the morning was beautiful, the weather was perfect, and the scenery and even prettier. That should have been my second indication that something was going to go wrong.

So we finally got around to getting to our Hostel: we got there way too early, no one could check us in. No biggie -- we took a nice walk. But when we got back to the Hostel, they hadn't received our request to cancel two beds...that was fun...eventually they canceled them, but it was fun, nonetheless.

When we finally got around going out to Oktoberfest, we noticed that our return train tickets were gone. Gone. Gone. Yes, they were gone. Somehow, Greg had lost them. Wtf? We had to go to the train station, get in line, and talk to some official who simply didn't care, pay 8€ extra for a reprint, and then have Greg try to blame me for losing the tickets from HIS bag. Needless to say, I took the tickets from him afterward and kept them with me. Imagine that, they were fine with me.

But don't worry, it still can get worse, and it does. So when we finally get to the Oktoberfest area, Greg is convinced that he is master of the world. Fuck. No. All he wants to do is tell me I'm wrong, argue with me about insignificant details, and prod at my sarcasm simply because he thinks I'm serious. It's absurd. Anything and everything I said from when we got off the train until we got to back to Berlin, he was criticizing and arguing against. I just wanted to tell him to STFU, but I didn't.

So after a little while, I just started to ignore him, and when he finally hit the spot (telling me I was wrong about how the Internet works...this was the same guy who didn't know was a Browser is), I just kinda went off, told him to shut his mouth, that he didn't know what he was talking about, and he was just blatantly wrong and making himself sound like a moron. I could have been meaner, but I have to live with guy for the rest of the semester. Fun.

But anyway, after that ordeal (which was a summary of the entire weekend with him in a few paragraphs), even more happened. Aside from his bickering, he got even stupider. Oh yes, I said it, he gots more stupider! So when we were in the tent the first day, Greg took it upon himself to drink everything and anything in sight. It was disgusting. Before the sun had even hit the horizon, he was so plastered that he passed out on the table. Now, this normally wouldn't have been a problem, but the people at the table were uncomfortable with him there and were asking me to move him. So I did. I made him stand to try to get a little more back into it...he refused and stayed seated. Then he threw up everywhere. Just...everywhere.

Security came and escorted him from the tent, and he ended up on the back lawn, drunk. WTF? I have nothing more to say...well, except that he threw up twice more on the way out. His lack of self control was....annoying, to say the least.

But still, get this, by the end of the weekend, not only had he spent all the money he brought with him, he was on the phone with his mother complaining about how he had no money left, as though she was the irresponsible one who blew 80€ on beer, and at least 40€ on crap food...in 1 weekend.

Now, you're probably think that that is not all that bad. Well, as you know, I like to follow the rules (except when they're rules that explicitly need to be broken), and I'm not too keen on breaking ones that I agree with. So, Saturday night, the tents were packed and closed. No surprise, it was a Saturday night at the biggest beer fest in Europe. The morons from NYU were convinced that we had to get into a tent, or a Biergarten, at least. Now, these were, by this point, reservation only, and security was standing there making sure that only people with reservations could get in.

What did they do? Sneak past security. Now, like I said, I don't like breaking rules like this. So after watching them get caught trying to sneak by about 2-3 times, I just left. Walked away and didn't even look back. Idiots.

And another reason this post is password protected: I don't want them to know where I went that night :-P

By the time they noticed, I was pretty much out of the fair grounds, and I refused to answer my phone / respond to texts. I was fed up with them, so I decided to go do what I felt would be the best use of my time: see the city. All I can say is that I am so glad that I left them behind,

I had such an awesome time walking around and seeing the sights at night. It was breathtaking and beautiful. And I shall share with you some of what I saw now.{{ pimg("img_2981.jpg") }}Let me frame this picture for you. Mirmer is a department store. That's right. This building is a STORE. Incredible, eh? You know what else is cool? How downtown Munich turns into a social and artsy place at night. Withing about 2 blocks of each other, there were two bands performing: one all female, the other all male. The females were playing very classical and pretty music, and the males were trying to put pop into classical music, and doing quite well at that.{{ pimg("img_2984.jpg") }}And now for the males...{{ pimg("img_3001.jpg") }}They were both very entertaining, and I have to say that I wish I would have stayed a little longer to listen to them. But I didn't and alas, we move forward.{{ pimg("img_2987.jpg") }}This building is, I believe, the city hall in Munich. This is also the building that is home to pedo bear. He can be found on the left side of the middle tower...but he can't be seen in this picture, sadly. And this building, strangely enough, was one of the few buildings that was actually really old: most of them were made to look modern and ugly.

However, I'm glad to see that the spirit of Munich lives on:{{ pimg("img_2993.jpg") }}I saw this little store right around the corner from the town hall, and I had to get a picture: "Poetry &amp; Truth: Good Books, Good Wine". Oh yeah, go Germans. "Of course I drink wine with my poetry, what am I, British?!"

And we continue even further...well, I'm kinda running out of things to say at this point, so let's just look at something that I kinda miss right now:{{ pimg("img_3007.jpg") }}Yep, New York -- you can't escape her, no matter where you go. She is always there...kinda like herpes...hmm.

And, finally, for the end of this post, let's look at some artsy stuff. First of all, let's look at something that is really pretty: these were just hanging inside of some covered walkway, and I just thought they would make an awesome picture:{{ pimg("img_3006.jpg") }}Turns out I was right...

Outside the city hall, too, there was a really cool fountain. At night, correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like an old man's hair dangling from the last remnants of his scalp there.{{ pimg("img_3011.jpg") }}Or perhaps I'm just crazy...

And, finally, because I'm feeling a bit sentimental, I leave off with a rose. A special, lone rose waiting there, forever, for someone.{{ pimg("img_3015.jpg") }}
