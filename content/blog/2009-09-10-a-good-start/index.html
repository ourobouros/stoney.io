Ahh, finally...a class that actually went well on the first day! So, for my architecture class, we met at a little café behind Humbolt, and we discussed what the class was to be, introduced ourselves, and talked a bit about what we already knew of architecture (ie. I knew that buildings could stand...).  It was pretty cool -- we had our first class meeting in a coffee shop. Anyway, once we got done with the basics, we headed right over to the Staatsbiblothek zu Berlin (The State Library of Berlin, the old one, at least) and went straight for the map section. To say that these maps were old and amazing is a drastic understatement.{{ pimg("img_2259.jpg") }}This little gem is a map straight from 1650 -- yes, it is an original map that was drawn in 1650. To think that that used to be Berlin... Also, if you look in the lower-lefthand corner of the map, you'll see two squares and line coming from it -- that is Unter den Linden Straße way back when it wasn't. Back then, it was a path to the king's private hunting grounds... Today, that is the center of Berlin. Amazing how things change.{{ pimg("img_2262.jpg") }}This map is from when Berlin grew a little bit: the green that looks kinda rigid and star-like is actually a wall that used to surround Berlin. Notice that there are suburbs outside of the actual wall -- mainly, the King's stuff was protected, and some of the suburbs weren't even built yet, so there was no real need for a wall. Anyway, weiter!{{ pimg("img_2265.jpg") }}And, of course, what would a journey through Berlin be with WWII? Yeah, this is a map from America of the key places to bomb (black) in Berlin -- I mean, not all of these were essential, they were just key areas. And, finally, to put the damage of WWII into perspective, let's look at a German map from after the war.{{ pimg("img_2271.jpg") }}I don't think I really even have to describe this map...dark = dead. Ugh.

So yeah, that's what we did in my architecture class today -- we looked at maps to better understand how cities evolve and change over time. Naturally, I didn't post all the maps we looked at, but these were the ones I thought were the coolest / most important.
