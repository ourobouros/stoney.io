Alrighty, so, Oktoberfest. What can I say about that? Well...it definitely was...

I guess the best place to start is from the beginning. When we first go there, it was empty...I mean, I wasn't bumping into people, I could move freely, and things were great. I got a few early morning shots, but nothing special...well, sorta. In Germany, it's helpful to remember that you're not in America: you don't have moronic, god-loving, everything-else-hating religious radicals who will shoot someone and then say that the first commandment is "thou shalt not kill." Anyway, with that in mind, it's also helpful to remember that Germans don't care about nudity or anything like it (more on the FKK later), and with that, I present what was atop one of the children's rides at Oktoberfest.{{ pimg("img_2525.jpg") }}Freaking priceless, isn't it? Yes, that is a naked woman atop a ride that was built for 5 year olds. Go Germany!

Anyway, after our first initial tour, we went to meet one of Greg's friend in the middle of the city -- it was fun, nothing to write home about. So after we returned to the grounds, we met up with a few other people from NYU in one of the tents. By the time we got there, one of them was already so drunk that he could hardly stand up, and it was even more entertaining because he hardly knew where he was. Well, he knew he was at Oktoberfest, but he didn't know much else. Priceless.

As I was looking around the tent, I got some nice pictures of some of the people there, including one girl who was having way too much fun at 12 (yes, he was drunk by 12).{{ pimg("img_2609.jpg") }}Awww, doesn't she look so happy? And no, I have no idea who she is, but I'm pretty sure she was sitting at our table for a little while there. Anyway, aside from that, I guess I shall just get this out of the way: I only had 1.5 beers my entire time at the fest. Yep, 1.5. At 8,50€ a beer, I decided that it was better not to blow everything I had on...beer. What am I, Homer? Well, there actually was a guy there who could probably rival Homer:{{ pimg("img_2644.jpg") }}See those three marks on his left arm? That's a count of the number of beers he had drunken so far. Notice the ceiling of the tent? It was still light out (around 5ish), and he'd gone through three beers. By the end of the night, he had AT LEAST 9 beers, 2 joints, and a couple shots of cocaine. It was amazing that he didn't just die...and I have to say, he was still quite a bit more sober than a lot of people in our group, and considerably smaller, too.

Speaking of drunks, as the day wore on, more and more NYU people started showing up, and soon it turned into a crazy American dance party with our own DJ, DJ Taylor!{{ pimg("img_2791.jpg") }}The band in the tent actually called her onto stage to direct, and let's just say she did an awesome job...granted, she had no idea what she was doing. In this picture, I say that the band messed up and she was frustrated, but in reality, she was so lost up there. I love it.

After she got down, let's just take a look at how much she had been drinking during that time, and then maybe you'll understand what really happened.{{ pimg("img_2837.jpg") }}Actually, that would have probably killed her. That's a collection of a FEW of the beer glasses that were on our table when we took this picture. Good times.

After the initial drinking, dancing, and the like, I continued to take pictures of the festivities of the night, that is, of course, until my roommate got so drunk that he threw up everywhere and was escorted from the tent by security. Oh yeah, it was incredible. Incredible, I tell you.{{ pimg("img_2844.jpg") }}I don't have a picture of security actually taking him out, but that's a picture of him floating on the clouds, laying on the back lawn where security threw him. When I got there, I took his wallet and camera -- he didn't need drunken pictures, and I wasn't going to let him buy any beer. What I love about this picture is that his glasses are missing. He left them inside. Just left them... So yeah, I just kinda told him to eat the pretzel, left him with 3€ for water, and went back inside (btw, he spent the water money on a ride...I'm glad I didn't leave his wallet).

About 20 minutes later, I'm not entirely sure how, he managed to show up back inside...meh... Since he was plastered, he fell asleep on the table and just kinda got lost in the night.

The rest of us, however, were still having a great time. Everyone was dancing, most people were on the benches jumping up and down, and I have pictures!{{ pimg("img_2915.jpg") }}That's Annie, kinda moving in the light, kinda not. She was not standing, for some reason, but insisted on sitting down and dancing. It was rather entertaining.{{ pimg("img_2937.jpg") }}And that is her standing on the bench and dancing. The guy over her shoulder makes me laugh -- he's at Oktoberfest and looks surprised at something he saw. Oh well.{{ pimg("img_2936.jpg") }}And this is Kevin pretending to dance. It's an awesome picture, though... Or maybe he was saying that he really is a superstar, who knows?

Anyway, I kinda danced the night away, and when I finally left, my legs were beyond sore. No, sore implies that they hadn't fallen off yet. They were killing me. I mean, not much else happened -- I don't really want to go into detail about how I danced and all that, for I'm sure it would kill you, so I shall just leave it at that.

After we left the tent, Kevin and Shevani decided that they wanted to go on a ride, so we kinda followed them around, and waited. Now, here is a cool picture that took me about 20 tries to get -- they were on a very-fast-spinning ride, and I couldn't get it just right, but this was the closest I got:{{ pimg("img_2979.jpg") }}I love the partial blur in the picture and how everything is kinda moving besides their car. As you can see, Kevin looks terrified (in the back), and Shevani is having a blast (in the front).

After that, we just went home and died. Not much else going on that night: rampant drinking, dancing, making fools of ourselves, and too many pictures. I consider that night a success.
