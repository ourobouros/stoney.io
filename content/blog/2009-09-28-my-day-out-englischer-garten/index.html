<p>So on Sunday, rather than going back to Oktoberfest (I had had enough of it by that point), I took a nice walk down through the Englischen Garten. To say the least, it was one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. The garten, if you don't know, is split into two parts that are a bit separated from each other. I started in the top half and worked my way down. In the middle of the two sections, I came upon one of the coolest art projects I have ever seen:{{ pimg("img_3029.jpg") }}Yep, it's an entire mural made out of backpacks. BACKPACKS! It was brilliant and beautiful. I mean, those Germans really do know how to do their art. As I continued walking, I came upon a bitter-sweet landmark: Hitler's former house in Munich. I mean, it is amazingly beautiful, but at the same time, it's kinda...well, Hitler...{{ pimg("img_3034.jpg") }}It looks absolutely amazing, but at the same time...ugh.

On a brighter note, once I was actually to the garten, things just got even more and more beautiful. I mean, this garten was, to say the least, a park. And it put our parks to shame. To shame!{{ pimg("img_3102.jpg") }}That was in the middle of the garten, just hanging out there. I was in the middle of the field just sitting and reading. I have to say, this was one of the best days that I have had in a VERY VERY LONG time. It was peaceful, the weather was perfect, the people were quiet. It was absolutely incredible. And it gets even better...wait for it!{{ pimg("img_3059.jpg") }}Dogs! Everyone brought their dogs here and let them run around. It was adorable. I mean, I was sitting there reading, and there were puppies running all around me. I was in dog heaven.

After I finished my reading, which I drew out to a couple of hours...whoops...I decided to take a walk around the park and see what else there was out there to see.{{ pimg("img_3044.jpg") }}I mean, even if you don't speak German (click the image to get a translation), you can tell what this sign is trying to tell you. But I guess it got its point across: I was not going to go swimming. But still, if you would have seen the water (wait for it), you really would have wanted to go swimming...and boy was I tempted.{{ pimg("img_3048.jpg") }}I mean, I was at an FKK (told you I would get to it!), the water looked amazing, and no one would have cared if a naked guy was swimming in it. But then again, I didn't want to die...so alas, no swimming for me. But as I continued to walk around, I came across some cooler stuff, still.{{ pimg("img_3088.jpg") }}This dog was so intent upon catching a duck that he refused to leave the water. You can't see it here, but his two front paws were in the water, and he was just staring. Trying to coerce a duck into coming his way. He failed. Poor puppy.{{ pimg("img_3123.jpg") }}And later, as I was finishing my walk, the same dog came up to me, and unlike the other dogs in Europe, he stuck his nose in my lap and asked me to pet him. He was so amazingly adorable. But back to my wanderings. Did I mention how perfect this place was? Don't believe me? Take a look at this:{{ pimg("img_3078.jpg") }}Is that not a scene from a movie? I mean, she's so happy to be giving this family a carriage ride, and the kid is so happy to be talking to her. It was just awesome.

And wait, it still gets better. Yes, better!{{ pimg("img_3132.jpg") }}What you see here is a horse. What you don't see is the owner of the horse training him. And if you look closely enough, you'll see naked people in the background, but we can just ignore that for now.

Finally, I just want to show one last thing that I thought was adorable and seriously put the finishing touches on this garten.
