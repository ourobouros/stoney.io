# About this site

This site is a mix of my own playground, info stash (sometimes called a "blog"), and random stuff
about me.

## The header

Since you can easily miss this one: click it clear it!

## The easter egg

There isn't one...or is there?  Let's just say I hope you remember your konami code.

## For ye modern browsers

I hope you enjoy the canvas and [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
