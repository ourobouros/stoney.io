			A simple CMS (content management system) for a historical foundation in Northern California.  I wrote a few custom modules for the site, namely the slideshow and the news modules.  Unlike other CMS's out there, this one allows full content editing directly on the page, so that the user can clearly see what is going to happen to the page before he hits save.

			This site is still under development, but it will one day feature the full Kelatox site, complete with a full CMS with in-context editing, an ecommerce module with Authorize.net and UPS integration, and many other features yet to come.

			This is a website for a small helicopter company based in Rialto, Ca.   They have complete control of all the content on the site (ie. a full content-control system).   I re-designed the site in an effort to make them more visible on the internet, to find a new way to increase business, and to create a new way for them to interact with the customers.<br><br>
